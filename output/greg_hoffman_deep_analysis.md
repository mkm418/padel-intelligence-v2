## SANDBAGGING ASSESSMENT

**Verdict: No. Greg is not sandbagging.**

Sandbagging = intentionally playing below true level to get easier draws. Signs would be: Playtomic level *lower* than demonstrated level, suspicious losses, etc.

**What the data shows:**
- **Playtomic:** 4.14
- **Model true level:** ~3.2–3.4
- **Gap:** Playtomic is *higher* than his demonstrated level by ~0.7–0.9 points

He is *overrated* on Playtomic, not underrated. He beats weak opponents (32–10 vs sub-3.0) but is 7–10 vs opponents 3.0+. His results support a 3.2–3.4 level, not 4.14.

If he were sandbagging, we would see: true level 4.0+, Playtomic 3.0, and him crushing everyone. Instead we see the opposite: Playtomic 4.14, true ~3.3, and him struggling vs 3.0+ opponents.
