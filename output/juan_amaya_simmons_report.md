**The 10-Game Rule**

Zero wins when scoring 0–9 games. Once he gets to 10? He's 41–15. That's a winning record. Stay in the match. Get to 10. He has 14 matches where he didn't get there.

**The Partner Paradox**

When his partner is a full level below the opponents, he goes 14–16. 48.7% of games. Maybe he plays up when he has to carry.

Juan Amaya is probably a 3.77. Playtomic says 4.34. The model says 3.77. Solid. Unspectacular. The kind of player you want on your team.

**Bottom line:** True level ~3.77. Get to 10 games. That's the job.
