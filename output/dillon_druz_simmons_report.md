## A Bill Simmons–Style Breakdown

---

**The Revenge of the Game Percentage**

Dillon Druz wins 54.0 percent of his games and only 68 percent of his matches. That gap is the whole story. He's not getting blown off the court—he's losing the games that matter.

**The 10-Game Rule**

Zero wins when scoring 0–9 games. Once he gets to 10? He's 50–8. That's a winning record. Stay in the match. Get to 10. He has 15 matches where he didn't get there.

**The Partner Paradox**

When his partner is a full level below the opponents, he goes 3–8. 42.3% of games. Maybe he plays up when he has to carry.

**The Simmons Verdict**

**Overall Grade: A**

Dillon Druz is probably a 3.2. Playtomic says 3.62. The model says 3.2. Solid. Unspectacular. The kind of player you want on your team.

**Bottom line:** True level ~3.2. Get to 10 games. That's the job.
