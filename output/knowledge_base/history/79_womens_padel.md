# Women's Padel: History, Growth, and How the Game Differs

Women's padel has undergone a remarkable transformation from near-invisibility to a thriving, increasingly equal segment of the sport. With women now comprising approximately 40% of all padel players globally, achieving equal prize money milestones, and generating growing broadcast audiences, the women's game is both a success story and a model for gender equity in sports. This article covers the history, current state, top players, and distinctive characteristics of women's padel.

## Historical Development

### Early Years (1970s-1990s)
Women were playing padel from the sport's earliest days in Mexico and Spain in the 1970s, but structured competition and recognition came slowly. During padel's formative decades, the sport was predominantly male-oriented in its competitive structures, media coverage, and investment.

### Institutionalization (1991-2000s)
The founding of the International Padel Federation (FIP) in 1991 created the first platform for organized women's international competition. The FIP World Championships included women's draws from the beginning, providing a competitive pathway. Argentina dominated the early women's World Championships, winning 8 titles, while Spain established itself as the other major powerhouse.

### Professional Era (2005-2020)
The launch of the Padel Pro Tour (2005) and later the World Padel Tour (2013) included women's professional draws, but prize money and media coverage lagged significantly behind the men's game. Women's matches often received less favorable scheduling, shorter broadcast windows, and substantially lower prize purses.

### The Equity Revolution (2020-Present)
The period since 2020 has been transformative for women's padel:
- Professional tours have progressively increased women's prize money
- Broadcasting of women's matches has expanded significantly
- Sponsorship deals increasingly cover both men's and women's players
- Public interest and attendance at women's events have grown substantially

## Growth Statistics

The numbers demonstrate women's padel's rapid expansion:

- **Global participation:** Women comprise approximately 40% of all padel players worldwide, a notably high percentage for any racket sport
- **Player growth:** Global padel participation grew from approximately 12 million in 2014 to over 35 million by 2025, with women's participation growing proportionally
- **Girls' youth participation:** Up 85% in Spain and 92% in Brazil within 18 months (as of 2025)
- **Federation membership:** 42% growth in registered members globally in 2025, with women's registrations growing faster than men's in several markets
- **Mothers' divisions:** Dedicated mothers-only competitive divisions have seen 68% registration increases, creating accessible pathways for women returning to sport

## Top Players

### Carolina Navarro Bjork (Spain)
One of the most decorated women's players in history, Navarro has won multiple World Padel Tour titles across a career spanning over a decade. Beyond her on-court achievements, she has been a vocal advocate for gender equality in padel, pushing for equal prize money and increased media coverage of the women's game.

### Marta Marrero (Spain)
A former professional tennis player who transitioned to padel, Marrero brought exceptional athleticism and tactical intelligence to the women's game. Her success demonstrated that padel could attract elite athletes from other sports and helped raise the competitive standard.

### Ariana Sanchez (Spain)
One of the dominant players of the current era. In the 2024 Premier Padel season, Sanchez and partner Paula Josemaria won 10 titles across 21 tournaments, earning approximately 337,000 euros each in prize money.

### Paula Josemaria (Spain)
Josemaria has established herself as one of the most dynamic right-side players in women's padel. Her partnership with Ariana Sanchez produced the most successful pairing of the 2024 season.

### Gemma Triay (Spain)
Known for her powerful left-side game and exceptional smashes, Triay has been a consistent top-ranked player and has helped popularize the more aggressive, athletic style of women's padel.

### Alejandra Salazar (Spain)
A veteran of the women's professional circuit, Salazar has won numerous titles across multiple partnerships and is respected for her tactical intelligence and consistency.

## How the Women's Game Differs from Men's

### Rally Length and Pattern
Women's padel typically features longer rallies than men's, with more extended baseline play and patient construction of points. While men's padel increasingly features short, explosive points decided by power shots, women's rallies more frequently develop through tactical maneuvering, placement, and patience.

### Tactical Emphasis
The women's game places proportionally greater emphasis on:
- **Lob play:** The lob is used more frequently as both offensive and defensive weapon
- **Consistency and placement** over raw power
- **Court positioning and movement** to create advantageous angles
- **Volleying precision** rather than volleying power
- **Point construction** through progressive pressure rather than single-shot winners

### Physical Demands
While both games are physically demanding, the women's game tends to feature:
- Longer average rally duration
- More sustained aerobic effort per point
- Less reliance on explosive overhead power (though smashing remains important)
- Greater emphasis on court coverage and defensive skills

### Pace and Rhythm
Men's professional padel has trended toward faster, more aggressive play with powerful drives and overhead smashes. Women's professional padel, while also becoming more aggressive, maintains a broader tactical palette where finesse, touch, and strategic shot selection remain decisive alongside power.

### Scoring Dynamics
Longer rallies mean that individual points in women's padel often involve more shot exchanges, creating different momentum dynamics and making consistency even more valuable than in the men's game.

## Equal Prize Money and Broadcast Milestones

The push for equality in women's padel has achieved significant milestones:

- **2025:** The Women's Padel World Tour achieved equal prize money of $1.2 million, matching the men's draw for the first time in history
- **Broadcast coverage:** Women's matches now receive primetime broadcasting on streaming platforms, averaging 1.3 million viewers
- **Female referees:** Representation climbed from 9% to 41%, reflecting broader inclusion across the sport's infrastructure
- **Sponsorship parity:** Major brands are increasingly signing women's players and teams at comparable rates
