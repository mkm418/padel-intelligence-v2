# Complete History of Padel: From 1969 to Global Phenomenon

Padel is one of the most remarkable sporting origin stories of the modern era. What began as one man's improvised solution to a space problem in Acapulco, Mexico has grown into a global phenomenon with over 35 million active players across 150 nations and 77,000+ courts worldwide. This is the complete timeline of padel's journey from a backyard invention to the fastest-growing sport in the world.

## The Invention: Acapulco, Mexico (1969)

In 1969, Enrique Corcuera, a Mexican businessman and sports enthusiast, wanted to build a tennis court at his vacation home in Acapulco but lacked the space. Instead, he adapted a smaller area by enclosing a 20x10-meter space with concrete walls on three sides and adding a tennis net across the middle. He combined elements of tennis, squash, and platform tennis to create a new game he called "Paddle-Corcuera."

The sport's defining innovation was born from necessity: the walls were not barriers but playing surfaces. Balls that bounced off the walls remained in play, creating longer rallies, more accessible gameplay, and a uniquely social dynamic. Corcuera wrote the first set of rules, establishing the underhand serve, the doubles-only format, and the enclosed court that define padel to this day.

## Spain: The European Gateway (1974)

In 1974, Alfonso de Hohenlohe, a Spanish aristocrat, businessman, and friend of Corcuera, visited Acapulco and fell in love with the sport. He brought padel to Europe by building the first two courts at his exclusive Marbella Club in southern Spain. Hohenlohe introduced the sport to European high society, attracting royalty, celebrities, and business elites. He also made crucial modifications to the court design, replacing some concrete walls with glass panels to improve visibility for spectators and refine the playing experience.

Padel quickly spread through Spain's private clubs and beach resorts, establishing the cultural foundation that would later make Spain the global epicenter of the sport.

## Argentina: Mass Adoption (Late 1970s-1980s)

Julio Menditegui, an Argentine who played padel at Hohenlohe's Marbella Club, introduced the sport to Argentina in the late 1970s. Argentina's adoption of padel was swift and democratic. While it initially appeared at exclusive clubs like Club Tortugas, by 1982 it had crossed socioeconomic boundaries, with courts appearing in neighborhoods across the country.

In 1988, the Argentine Padel Association (APA) was founded, becoming the world's first national padel federation. By the 1990s, padel had become Argentina's second most popular sport after football, with millions of players and thousands of courts. Argentina would go on to produce many of the sport's greatest players, including Fernando Belasteguin.
