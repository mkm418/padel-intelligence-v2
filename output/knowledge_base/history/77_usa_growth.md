# Padel Growth in the United States: 2020-2026

The United States represents padel's largest untapped market and potentially its most transformative growth frontier. From fewer than 20 courts in 2019 to over 650 courts across 31 states by 2025, the U.S. padel story is one of exponential early-stage growth, significant investment, and immense remaining potential. With projections of 30,000 courts and 10 million players by 2030, the American market could eventually rival Spain's padel ecosystem in scale.

## Timeline: Key Milestones

### Pre-2020: The Quiet Beginning
- Padel existed in the U.S. in a minimal form, with fewer than 20 courts concentrated in a handful of locations
- The United States Padel Association (USPA) was operating but with limited membership and visibility
- Awareness of padel was essentially zero outside of small expatriate communities from Spain, Argentina, and other padel-playing nations
- **2020 USPA membership:** 163 members

### 2020-2021: COVID-Era Discovery
- Padel benefited from the same outdoor sports boom that drove pickleball growth during the pandemic
- Early courts in Miami, New York, and other metropolitan areas began attracting curious players
- First media coverage introduced padel to American sports audiences
- Entrepreneurs who had discovered padel in Spain and Latin America began planning U.S. facilities

### 2022-2023: Infrastructure Acceleration
- Court construction accelerated significantly, with new facilities opening in Florida, Texas, California, and the Northeast
- Indoor facilities began opening in regions with cold winters, enabling year-round play
- First professional events and exhibitions on U.S. soil raised the sport's profile
- Equipment brands entered the American market
- Player participation began increasing at approximately 250% compared to 2022 levels

### 2024: Breakout Year
- **688 courts** operational nationwide, up from approximately 200 just two years earlier
- **Over 100,000 active players** for the first time
- **USPA membership reached 1,917,** a 12x increase from 2020
- Equipment sales hit $10 million with projected 70%+ growth trajectory
- Licensed padel professionals nearing 2,000
- Florida emerged as the dominant market with 268 courts (41% of U.S. total)

### 2025-2026: Irreversible Momentum
- Over 650 courts across 31 states
- Approximately 112,872 active players
- The 2025 State of Padel Report declared the growth trajectory "irreversible"
- Franchising models began emerging, offering standardized facility development
- Indoor facilities thriving in Northeast, Midwest, and Texas markets
- Plans for thousands of additional courts in development

## Geographic Distribution

The U.S. padel market has clear geographic leaders:

| State/Region | Courts (2024) | Share | Notes |
|--------------|---------------|-------|-------|
| Florida | 268 | 41% | Year-round outdoor play, Latin American community |
| Texas | Growing | ~10% | Strong Hispanic population, warm climate |
| California | Growing | ~8% | Tech and wellness culture, outdoor lifestyle |
| New York/NJ | Growing | ~7% | Indoor facilities, high population density |
| Midwest | Emerging | ~5% | Indoor-focused, corporate wellness driven |

## The Market Opportunity

The scale of the U.S. opportunity is staggering when compared to mature markets:

- **Court density gap:** The U.S. currently has one padel court per 504,360 people. Spain has one per 2,824 people. Reaching even 10% of Spain's density would require tens of thousands of new courts
- **Revenue potential:** Projections suggest 10x court growth and 5x player growth by 2030, generating hundreds of millions in annual revenue from court rentals, equipment, coaching, events, and hospitality
- **Addressable population:** The U.S. has approximately 23 million tennis players and 48 million pickleball participants, both of whom represent natural conversion demographics for padel

## Major Investors and Key Players

- **Conquer Padel:** Planning major facility development including a planned location in Lehi, Utah
- **AFP Courts:** Major court construction company that has played a key role in the U.S. padel infrastructure build-out
- **USPA:** The national governing body overseeing competition, coaching certification, and sport development
- **International tours:** Premier Padel and FIP events have begun including U.S. venues in their calendars
- **Real estate developers:** Increasingly adding padel courts to residential, commercial, and mixed-use developments

## Challenges

Despite the momentum, the U.S. market faces significant challenges:

### Awareness Gap
The vast majority of Americans have never heard of padel. Building awareness requires sustained marketing investment, media partnerships, and grassroots introduction events.

### Pickleball Competition
Pickleball's head start in the U.S. means it has captured much of the "new racket sport" attention and infrastructure investment. Padel must differentiate itself clearly and may face competition for court space and player attention.

### Infrastructure Costs
Building padel courts in the U.S. is more expensive than in Spain or Latin America due to higher construction costs, real estate prices, and regulatory requirements. Indoor courts, necessary for year-round play in most of the country, add significant cost.

### Coaching Supply
There are not enough qualified padel coaches in the U.S. to support rapid growth. Training and certifying coaches is a bottleneck that must be addressed to maintain quality as new players enter the sport.

### Operational Excellence
A global analysis noted that sustainable padel growth requires moving beyond just building courts to creating compelling, well-operated experiences. The U.S. market, accustomed to high-quality fitness and entertainment facilities, demands professional operations from day one.
