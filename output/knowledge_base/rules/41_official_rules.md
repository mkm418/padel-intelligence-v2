# Complete Official Padel Rules 2025-2026

Padel is governed by the International Padel Federation (FIP), which publishes and maintains the official rulebook used across all sanctioned competitions worldwide. The rules below reflect the 2025-2026 Premier Padel Rulebook and FIP Game Regulations.

## The Court

A padel court is a rectangular enclosed playing area measuring **20 meters long by 10 meters wide**, divided by a net. The court is surrounded by walls made of glass (back walls and portions of side walls) and metallic mesh fencing. The net height is **0.88 meters at the center** and **0.92 meters at the posts**. Service lines are marked **6.95 meters from the net** on each side, and a center line divides each service area into two boxes.

## Scoring System

Padel uses the same scoring system as tennis within games: **15, 30, 40, and game**. Matches are played **best of 3 sets**, with each set won by the first pair to reach 6 games with a 2-game lead. At 6-6, a tiebreak is played. In professional circuits since 2020, the **golden point** rule applies at 40-40 (deuce), meaning a single deciding point replaces the traditional advantage system. The receiving pair chooses which side to receive on for the golden point.

## The Serve

The serve is one of padel's most distinctive elements:

- **Underhand only**: The ball must be struck at or below **waist level**
- **Bounce first**: The server must bounce the ball on the ground before hitting it
- **Position**: The server stands behind the service line and serves diagonally into the opponent's service box
- **Two attempts**: Each server gets a first and second serve per point
- **Foot faults**: At least one foot must remain on the ground during contact; stepping on or over the service line is a fault
- **Wall rule on serve**: After bouncing in the correct box, the ball may touch the back glass wall but **cannot touch the side fence (metallic mesh)** — if it does, it's a fault

## Lets

A **let** is called and the serve is replayed when:

- The ball clips the net cord and still lands correctly in the service box (without touching the fence before the second bounce)
- Play is interrupted by an external factor (ball from another court, obstruction)
- A player is not ready and makes no attempt to return

There is no limit to the number of consecutive lets.

## Faults and Loss of Point

A point is lost when:

- The ball bounces **twice** on your side of the court
- The ball hits the **metallic fence directly** (without bouncing first) on your side
- A player touches the **net or net posts** during a point
- A player hits the ball **before it crosses the net** (reaching over)
- The ball hits a player or their partner
- A player hits the ball **twice** in succession
- The ball exits the court without bouncing on the opponent's side (except through authorized openings where a player may exit to play the ball)

## Wall Play and Rebounds

This is what makes padel unique:

- During rallies, after the ball bounces on the ground, it may rebound off **any wall** (glass or fence) and remain in play
- Players can play the ball off their **own walls** to return it over the net
- The ball must always bounce on the ground **before** hitting a wall on the opponent's side — a direct hit to the wall without a ground bounce is out
- Players may exit the court through designated openings to play a ball that has bounced and left the enclosure

## Side Changes and Rest Periods

Players change ends after every **odd game** (1-0, 2-1, 3-2, etc.). A 90-second rest is allowed during changeovers, and a **120-second break** is permitted between sets. Medical timeouts and toilet breaks follow tour-specific regulations.

## Equipment Regulations

- **Racket**: Maximum length 45.5 cm (including handle), maximum width 26 cm. Must be solid with perforated holes (no strings). A wrist strap is mandatory
- **Balls**: Approved padel balls must conform to FIP specifications (diameter 6.35-6.77 cm, weight 56-59.4 g, bounce height 135-145 cm when dropped from 2.54 m)

## Key Takeaways

- Padel is always played in doubles on an enclosed 20x10m court
- Scoring mirrors tennis but with golden point at deuce in professional play
- The serve must be underhand, bounced, and below waist height
- Walls are in play after the ball bounces — this is padel's signature mechanic
- The ball can never hit the metallic mesh/fence directly on a serve
