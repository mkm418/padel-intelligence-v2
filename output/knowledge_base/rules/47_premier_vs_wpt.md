# Premier Padel vs World Padel Tour: Rule Differences, Rankings, and Unification

The professional padel landscape underwent a seismic transformation between 2022 and 2025. What was once a confusing two-tour system has merged into a single unified circuit under the International Padel Federation (FIP). Understanding this history and the current structure is essential for following professional padel today.

## The Two-Tour Era (2022-2023)

### World Padel Tour (WPT)
- Founded in 2005 as the first professional padel circuit
- Based in Spain, the heartland of professional padel
- Organized by Setpoint Events with exclusive player contracts
- Used the **golden point** (Punto de Oro) rule at 40-40
- Had its own independent ranking system
- Featured tournaments mainly in Spain with some international events

### Premier Padel
- Launched in 2022, backed by Qatar Sports Investments (QSI) and the FIP
- Positioned as the official FIP-sanctioned world tour
- Used the **traditional advantage system** (no golden point)
- Offered significantly higher prize money
- Created a separate FIP-based ranking system
- Focused on global expansion with events across multiple continents

### Key Rule Differences During the Split

| Rule/Feature | World Padel Tour | Premier Padel |
|-------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Deuce system | Golden point (single point) | Traditional advantage |
| Rankings | WPT proprietary rankings | FIP rankings |
| Player contracts | Exclusive contracts required | Open entry based on ranking |
| Tournament categories | Master, Open, Challenger | Major, P1, P2 |
| Governing body | Setpoint Events (private) | FIP (federation) |
| Geographic focus | Spain-centric | Global expansion |

## The Merger (2023-2024)

In late 2023, Premier Padel's parent organization (QSI) acquired the World Padel Tour, ending the bitter rivalry that had divided the sport. The unification process involved:

1. **Combining both tours** under the Premier Padel brand, governed by the FIP
2. **Merging ranking systems** into a single unified FIP ranking
3. **Ending exclusive player contracts** — all players now compete under one open system
4. **Establishing the CUPRA FIP Tour** as the feeder circuit below Premier Padel
5. **Harmonizing competition formats** across all tournament categories

The merger was widely celebrated as a turning point for padel's growth, removing the confusion and conflict that had held the sport back from mainstream recognition.

## The Unified Tour Structure (2025-2026)

### Tournament Categories (Highest to Lowest)

1. **Majors** — The flagship events (4 per year), offering 2,000 ranking points for winners
2. **Finals** — Season-ending championship for top-ranked pairs
3. **P1 Events** — High-profile tournaments (1,000 points for winners)
4. **P2 Events** — Secondary professional events (600 points for winners)
5. **CUPRA FIP Tour** — Feeder circuit with Platinum, Gold, Silver, and Bronze tiers

### Ranking System

The unified FIP ranking counts each player's **best 22 results** from the previous 52 weeks across Premier Padel and CUPRA FIP Tour events. Points operate on a defense system — players must match or exceed their previous year's results in corresponding tournament weeks to maintain their ranking.

### 2025 Adjustments

Following player feedback at ranking committee meetings in March 2025:
- Men's draw sizes for P1 and P2 reverted to 2024 levels
- Women's draw sizes were maintained
- Prize money was increased
- Hotel accommodation costs for women's players were covered by the tour

### 2026 Season Developments

The 2026 calendar features significant evolution:
- **26 tournaments** across **18 countries**
- Nearly **75% played indoors** for consistent conditions
- New cities added including **London** and **Pretoria**
- Introduction of the **"Star Point" scoring system**, approved by the FIP General Assembly after extensive player consultations
- Ongoing discussions about draw size optimization

## Remaining Challenges

Despite unification, several challenges persist:

- **Transition pain**: Some players and fans still reference the "old" WPT era and rankings
- **Golden point debate**: Whether the unified tour should adopt golden point, advantage, or the new Star Point system continues to evolve
- **Global parity**: While expanding internationally, Spain and Argentina still dominate player development
- **Commercial growth**: Building a unified broadcast and sponsorship strategy across a global calendar
- **Player welfare**: Balancing tournament quantity, travel demands, and financial sustainability

## Impact on the Sport

The merger has delivered clear benefits:
- **One clear ranking** — no more split loyalties or confusing dual rankings
- **Higher prize money** — consolidated commercial power attracts larger sponsors
- **Global calendar** — padel reaches new markets rather than over-saturating Spain
- **Player freedom** — no exclusive contracts mean the best players always compete
- **Clearer pathway** — CUPRA FIP Tour provides a transparent development route to the main tour

## Key Takeaways

- The WPT and Premier Padel merged in 2023-2024 under a single FIP-governed circuit
- The unified tour uses FIP rankings based on best 22 results over 52 weeks
- Tournament hierarchy runs from Majors down through P1, P2, and CUPRA FIP Tour events
- The 2026 season introduces the Star Point scoring system and expands to 26 events in 18 countries
- The merger resolved the split that had divided players, rankings, and fan attention
- Professional padel is now better positioned for global growth under one governing structure
