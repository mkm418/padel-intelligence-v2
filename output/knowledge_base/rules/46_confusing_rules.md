# Padel Rules That Confuse Beginners: Double Bounce, Wall Play, Let Serves, and Net Touch

Padel's enclosed court and wall play create a ruleset unlike any other racket sport. Even experienced tennis players stumble on padel-specific rules when they first step onto the court. This guide breaks down the most commonly confused rules with clear explanations and practical examples.

## 1. The Double Bounce Rule (Two Bounces = Point Over)

**The rule**: The ball can only bounce on the ground **once** on your side before you must return it. If it bounces twice on the floor, the point goes to your opponents.

**Where beginners get confused**: After the ball bounces once on the floor and then rebounds off a wall, beginners often think it has "bounced twice." It hasn't. The wall rebound doesn't count as a bounce — only **floor contact** counts.

**Practical example**: The ball bounces on the floor, then hits the back glass and comes off the wall. You can still play this ball — it has only bounced once (on the floor). However, if the ball bounces on the floor, hits the wall, and then bounces on the floor **again** before you reach it, that's two floor bounces and the point is lost.

**Tip**: Train yourself to count **floor bounces only**. Walls are simply redirections, not bounces.

## 2. Wall Play During Rallies

**The rule**: After the ball bounces on the ground, it can hit any wall (glass or metallic mesh) and remain in play. You can also hit the ball off **your own** back wall to send it back over the net.

**Where beginners get confused**:

- **"Can I play the ball off the glass?"** — Yes, after a floor bounce, the ball rebounding off any wall is still live
- **"Can I hit the ball into my own wall?"** — Yes, you can play the ball off your own back glass to lob it over the net. This is a fundamental padel tactic called a "wall shot" or "contrapared"
- **"Can the ball hit the wall before the floor on the other side?"** — No. When the ball crosses the net, it **must bounce on the floor first** before hitting a wall. A ball that hits the wall or fence directly (without a floor bounce) on the opponent's side is out

**Tip**: Think of the walls as extensions of the court, but only after the ball has already touched the floor.

## 3. The Serve: More Rules Than You Think

### Underhand Serve Only

**The rule**: The ball must be struck at or below **waist level** with an underhand motion. You must bounce the ball on the ground before hitting it.

**Where beginners get confused**: Tennis players instinctively try to serve overhand or at shoulder height. In padel, any serve where contact is made above the waist is a fault. The ball must also be bounced first — you cannot toss and hit like in tennis.

### Serve Landing Rules

**The rule**: The serve must land in the **diagonal service box**. After bouncing in the box, it can hit the back glass wall. However, it **cannot** touch the **side metallic fence** before the second bounce.

**Where beginners get confused**: The distinction between "glass wall" (OK after bounce) and "metallic fence/mesh" (fault) is one of padel's most confusing serve rules. If the serve bounces in the box and then hits the glass, it's fine. If it touches the wire mesh/fence, it's a fault.

### Foot Faults

**The rule**: At least one foot must be on the ground and behind the service line at the moment of contact.

**Where beginners get confused**: Unlike tennis, you cannot jump while serving. At least one foot must remain planted on the ground when you strike the ball.

## 4. Let Serves

**The rule**: If the serve clips the **net cord** and still lands correctly in the service box (without hitting the fence before the second bounce), it's a **let** — the serve is replayed without penalty. There is no limit to consecutive lets.

**Where beginners get confused**:
- A ball that clips the net and lands **outside** the service box is a fault, not a let
- A ball that clips the net, lands in the service box, then touches the **fence** before the receiver can play it is also a fault, not a let
- A ball that clips the net and lands in the box, then touches the **glass** (not fence), is still a let

**Tip**: "Let" = net touch + correct landing + no fence contact.

## 5. Net Touch and Net Rules

**The rule**: You cannot touch the net, net post, or the opponent's court with any part of your body or racket during a point. Doing so results in immediate loss of point.

**Where beginners get confused**:
- **"Can the ball hit the net during a rally?"** — Yes. During rallies (not serves), the ball can clip the net and continue — there is no let during rallies. If it goes over and lands in, play continues
- **"Can I reach over the net?"** — No. You cannot hit the ball before it has crossed to your side. Your racket can follow through over the net after contact, but it must not touch the net
- **"What if I accidentally touch the net?"** — Any physical contact with the net during a live point loses you the point, regardless of intention

## 6. The Return of Serve

**The rule**: The **receiver must let the serve bounce** before returning it. You cannot volley the return of serve.

**Where beginners get confused**: After the return of serve, volleys are allowed during the rest of the rally. Only the initial return of serve requires a bounce. The server's partner and receiver's partner are not affected by this rule — it applies only to the actual return stroke.

## 7. Exiting the Court

**The rule**: Players can exit the court through designated openings to play a ball that has bounced inside the court and then traveled out of the enclosure.

**Where beginners get confused**: This is legal and actually happens in professional matches. If a high lob bounces on your side and clears the back wall, you can run out the side opening and play the ball back over the fence/wall. The ball remains in play as long as it hasn't bounced twice on the floor.

## Quick Reference: Is It In or Out?

| Scenario | Ruling |
|----------|--------|
| Ball bounces on floor, then hits back glass | **In play** |
| Ball bounces on floor, then hits side fence | **In play** |
| Ball hits wall directly without floor bounce (opponent's side) | **Out** |
| Serve bounces in box, then hits back glass | **Good serve** |
| Serve bounces in box, then hits side fence | **Fault** |
| Ball clips net during rally and goes over | **In play** (no let) |
| Ball clips net on serve and lands in box | **Let** (replay) |

## Key Takeaways

- Only **floor bounces** count — wall rebounds are not bounces
- Walls are in play after a floor bounce, and you can play off your own walls
- The serve must be underhand, bounced, and below waist level
- Serves can touch the back glass but never the side fence
- Let = serve hits net + lands in box + no fence contact
- You cannot touch the net during play, but the ball can clip the net during rallies
- The return of serve must bounce — no volleys on the return
