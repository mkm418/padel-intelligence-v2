# How Padel Rankings Work: FIP Rankings, National Rankings, and Points Systems

Understanding padel's ranking system is essential for following the professional tour, entering competitions, and tracking your progress as a player. The system spans from the global FIP rankings governing the world's top professionals down to national and club-level rating systems for recreational players.

## FIP World Rankings

The FIP (International Padel Federation) ranking is the **official global ranking** for professional padel, governing entry and seeding for all Premier Padel and CUPRA FIP Tour events.

### How Points Are Calculated

Each player's ranking is determined by their **best 22 tournament results** from the previous 52 weeks. Points are awarded based on the tournament category and the round reached:

#### Premier Padel Points Table

| Tournament | Winner | Finalist | Semi-Final | Quarter-Final | R16 | R32 |
|-----------|--------|----------|------------|---------------|-----|-----|
| **Major** | 2,000 | 1,200 | 720 | 360 | 180 | 90 |
| **Finals** | 1,500 | 900 | 600 | 400 | — | — |
| **P1** | 1,000 | 600 | 360 | 180 | 90 | 45 |
| **P2** | 600 | 360 | 215 | 108 | 54 | 27 |

#### CUPRA FIP Tour Points Table

| Tournament Tier | Winner | Finalist | Semi-Final | Quarter-Final |
|----------------|--------|----------|------------|---------------|
| **Platinum** | 300 | 180 | 108 | 54 |
| **Gold** | 150 | 90 | 54 | 27 |
| **Silver** | 75 | 45 | 27 | 14 |
| **Bronze** | 40 | 24 | 14 | 7 |

Qualifying round victories also earn **bonus points** (typically 10-30), providing additional incentive for players fighting through qualification.

### The Defense Points System

Points in the FIP ranking operate on a **rolling 52-week cycle**. This means:

- Points earned at a specific tournament expire exactly one year later
- Players must **defend** their points by matching or exceeding their previous year's performance at the same event
- If a player performed better this year, they gain points. If worse, they lose the difference
- Skipping a tournament that was played the previous year results in losing all points from that event

**Example**: A player who won a P1 event (1,000 points) last year must reach the final again (600 points) to retain 600 of those points. If they lose in the quarterfinals (180 points), they lose a net 820 points from their ranking.

This system rewards **consistent performance** across the full calendar rather than isolated strong results.

### Ranking Updates

The FIP ranking is updated **weekly**, typically on Monday mornings, reflecting results from the previous week's tournaments. The ranking history on the FIP website now extends back to **1986 for men** and **1990 for women**, providing unprecedented historical context.

## National Ranking Systems

Each country with an established padel federation maintains its own national ranking system. These are essential for domestic competition entry, team selection, and player development.

### United Kingdom (LTA Padel Rankings)

- Based on a player's **best 6 results** within the previous 52 weeks
- Points awarded from LTA Padel Tour tournaments
- Organized by age group: 11U, 12U, 14U, 16U, 18U, Open, and Seniors (35+)
- Players can "play up" to higher age groups but need minimum results in their own group first
- Rankings determine seeding and entry for LTA-sanctioned events

### Spain (FEP Rankings)

- The largest national padel system in the world
- Multiple ranking tiers corresponding to tournament categories
- Closely aligned with the FIP system due to Spain's dominance in professional padel
- Regional rankings feed into national rankings

### United States (USPA Rankings)

- Uses age categories: M35+, M45+, M55+ (men) and W35+, W45+, W55+ (women)
- Three tournament tiers: **Nationals**, **Regionals**, and **Locals** — each awarding different points
- Growing rapidly as padel expands across the US

### Argentina (APA Rankings)

- Second-largest national system after Spain
- Deeply integrated club system with local, provincial, and national tiers
- Produces many of the world's top professional players

## Club and Recreational Rating Systems

For non-competitive players, many countries use simplified **rating scales** to facilitate fair matchups and social play:

### British Padel Rating System (BPRS)

A numeric scale from **1.0 to 7.0** organized into three divisions:

- **Division C (1.0-3.0)**: Beginners learning basic technique and court positioning
- **Division B (3.5-5.0)**: Intermediate players with consistency, court awareness, and some tournament experience
- **Division A (5.5-7.0)**: Advanced tournament players and professionals

Ratings are assigned by affiliated padel coaches and help clubs organize balanced social play, Americano events, and internal leagues.

## How to Improve Your Ranking

### Professional Level
- Enter as many sanctioned events as possible within the 22-tournament window
- Prioritize higher-category tournaments for more ranking points
- Build consistency — defending points requires sustained performance across the full year
- Partner strategically with players whose ranking goals align with yours

### National/Club Level
- Participate regularly in your federation's sanctioned tournaments
- Target your best 6 (or relevant number) results rather than entering everything
- Consider playing in your correct age group before playing up
- Track your points and identify which results will drop off in the coming weeks

## Key Takeaways

- The FIP ranking uses each player's best 22 results over a rolling 52-week period
- Major winners earn 2,000 points; CUPRA FIP Bronze winners earn 40 points
- The defense system means points must be actively maintained by matching previous year's results
- National rankings (LTA, FEP, USPA, APA) govern domestic competition with their own point scales
- Club-level ratings (like the BPRS 1.0-7.0 system) facilitate fair recreational play
- Rankings are updated weekly and now include historical data back to 1986
