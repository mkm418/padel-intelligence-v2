# Padel Match Formats Around the World: Best of 3, Super Tiebreaks, and Variations

Unlike tennis, which has largely standardized its match formats at the professional level, padel employs a surprisingly diverse range of match formats across different federations, tournament levels, and competition types. Understanding these formats is crucial for players entering tournaments, organizers planning events, and fans following the sport.

## Professional Standard: Best of 3 Sets

At the highest level of padel (Premier Padel, CUPRA FIP Tour), the standard format is:

- **Best of 3 sets**, each played to 6 games
- **Tiebreak at 6-6** in every set (first to 7 points, must win by 2)
- **Golden point or advantage** at 40-40, depending on the specific tournament rules and era
- No super tiebreak — every set is played in full

This format typically produces matches lasting **60-90 minutes**, though intense three-setters can extend beyond two hours.

## FFT Approved Formats (France)

The French Tennis Federation (FFT), which oversees padel in France, has approved **9 distinct match formats** as of 2023, providing the most comprehensive framework for different competition needs:

### A Formats (Full Three-Set Matches)
- **A1**: 3 sets to 6 games, tiebreak at 6-6 (standard format)
- **A2**: 3 sets to 6 games with **decisive point** (golden point) at 40-40
- **Rest**: Minimum 1.5 hours between matches

### B Formats (Two Sets + Super Tiebreak)
- **B1**: 2 sets to 6 games; if one set each, a **super tiebreak to 10 points** decides the match
- **B2**: Same as B1 but with decisive point at 40-40
- **Rest**: Minimum 1 hour between matches

### C Formats (Short Sets + Super Tiebreak)
- **C1**: 2 sets to **4 games** with a tiebreak at 4-4; if one set each, super tiebreak to 10 points
- **C2**: Same as C1 with decisive point at 40-40
- **Rest**: Minimum 30 minutes between matches

### D Formats (Single Long Set)
- **D1**: 1 set to **9 games** with a decisive tiebreak at 7 points when the score reaches 8-8
- **D2**: Same as D1 with decisive point at 40-40
- **Rest**: Minimum 30 minutes between matches

### E Format (Points-Based)
- **E**: 1 set to **10 points** (reserved for P25 tournaments and specific competition categories)
- The most condensed format, designed for high-volume tournament schedules

## Super Tiebreak Explained

The super tiebreak (or "super decisive game") is padel's primary short-format decider:

- Played instead of a full third set when the match is tied 1-1 in sets
- **First to 10 points** with a minimum 2-point lead required
- If tied at 9-9, play continues until a 2-point gap is achieved
- Service rotation follows the same pattern as a standard tiebreak
- Court changes occur every 6 points

The super tiebreak typically takes **8-15 minutes** to complete, making it significantly faster than a full third set (which could take 30-60 minutes).

## Best of 5 in Padel?

Best-of-5 formats are **extremely rare** in padel. Unlike tennis Grand Slams, no major padel tournament currently uses a best-of-5 format. The reasons include:

- Padel matches are played entirely in doubles, which is already physically demanding
- Court scheduling constraints (enclosed courts are more limited than open tennis courts)
- Player welfare concerns — professionals play frequent tournaments across a long season
- Broadcasting considerations — predictable match lengths are preferred

However, exhibition matches and special events have occasionally used extended formats for entertainment value.

## Time-Limited Formats

For recreational and social play, time-limited formats are increasingly popular:

- **Timed matches** (15, 20, or 30 minutes) with the leading team winning when time expires
- Used extensively in **Americano** and **Mexicano** tournaments
- If tied when time expires, one additional point or a mini-tiebreak decides the match
- Ideal for events with fixed schedules and multiple courts

## Regional Variations

### Spain
The birthplace of padel uses standard FIP formats at the professional level and FFT-equivalent formats at club level. Golden point is widely adopted across all competition levels.

### Argentina
Historically used longer formats with traditional advantage scoring. Some provincial federations still prefer advantage over golden point.

### United Kingdom
The LTA Padel Tour uses standard best-of-3 formats with tiebreaks. Club events frequently use B-format (two sets plus super tiebreak) to manage court time.

### Scandinavia
Indoor padel-dominant markets (Sweden, Finland, Denmark) often use shorter formats (C or D type) during winter league seasons to maximize court usage.

### Middle East and Asia
Growing padel markets tend to adopt FIP standard formats directly, though club-level play often uses time-limited or points-based formats for social events.

## Choosing the Right Format for Your Event

| Format | Best For | Duration | Courts Needed |
|--------|----------|----------|---------------|
| A1/A2 (Full 3 sets) | Competitive tournaments, finals | 60-120 min | Fewer courts, more time |
| B1/B2 (2 sets + super TB) | Club tournaments, league matches | 45-75 min | Balanced |
| C1/C2 (Short sets + super TB) | Time-limited events, large draws | 30-50 min | More matches per court |
| D1/D2 (Single long set) | Fast-format leagues, round-robins | 25-45 min | Maximum efficiency |
| E (Points-based) | Social events, Americano-style | 15-25 min | Maximum throughput |

## Key Takeaways

- Professional padel uses best-of-3 sets with tiebreaks as the standard format
- The FFT recognizes 9 formats (A through E) ranging from full three-set matches to single 10-point games
- Super tiebreaks to 10 points replace the third set in many competition formats
- Best-of-5 is essentially unused in padel
- Time-limited formats are popular for social and recreational events
- The right format depends on competition level, available time, court availability, and player numbers
