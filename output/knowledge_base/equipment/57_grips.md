# Padel Overgrips and Base Grips: Thickness, Tackiness, and Impact on Play

The grip is your only physical connection to the padel racket. Yet it's one of the most overlooked and under-maintained pieces of equipment. A fresh, properly chosen grip improves control, reduces injury risk, and enhances every shot. A worn grip can cost you points, cause blisters, and even lead to the racket slipping from your hand.

## Base Grip vs Overgrip: What's the Difference?

### Base Grip (Replacement Grip)

The base grip is the **original grip** that comes pre-installed on the racket handle.

**Characteristics:**
- Thicker and more cushioned than overgrips (typically 1.5-2.0mm)
- Provides the foundational layer of comfort and shock absorption
- Rarely needs replacement unless it deteriorates significantly
- Attached directly to the handle with adhesive backing
- Creates the baseline handle diameter that overgrips build upon

### Overgrip

An overgrip is a **thin wrap** applied over the base grip for enhanced feel and customization.

**Characteristics:**
- Very thin (typically 0.4-0.7mm per layer)
- Designed to be replaced frequently as it wears
- Provides the playing surface you actually feel during matches
- Allows players to customize grip thickness, feel, and tackiness
- Much cheaper than base grips — designed as a consumable item

## Why Overgrips Matter in Padel

Padel has unique grip demands compared to tennis:

- **Shorter, more compact swings** require precise grip control
- **Continental grip** is used for most shots, meaning the hand position is consistent and wear patterns are concentrated
- **Wall shots** require quick wrist adjustments that depend on secure grip feel
- **Underhand serving** involves a specific grip pressure that benefits from consistent tackiness
- **Doubles communication** through racket signals requires confident handling

## Overgrip Properties

### Tackiness

Tacky overgrips have a slightly sticky surface that **adheres to your hand**, reducing the need for tight squeezing.

**Advantages:**
- Better control without excessive grip pressure
- Reduces hand and forearm fatigue
- Improved feel during delicate shots (drop shots, lobs)

**Disadvantages:**
- Tackiness fades faster than dry grips, requiring more frequent replacement
- Can feel uncomfortable for players who prefer a drier sensation
- Less effective in very humid conditions where sweat overwhelms the tackiness

**Popular tacky overgrips:** Head XtremeSoft, Wilson Pro Overgrip, Babolat VS Original

### Dry/Absorbent Overgrips

Dry overgrips prioritize **sweat absorption** over tackiness, maintaining a consistent feel even with heavy perspiration.

**Advantages:**
- Excellent for sweaty hands and hot/humid conditions
- Maintain consistent feel throughout long matches
- Preferred by players who sweat heavily

**Disadvantages:**
- Less initial "stick" than tacky grips
- Can feel rough when completely dry
- May require a warm-up period to reach optimal feel

**Popular dry overgrips:** Tourna Grip, Yonex Super Grap Dry, Wilson Pro Overgrip Perforated

### Perforated Overgrips

Some overgrips feature **small holes punched through the material** for ventilation.

**Advantages:**
- Improved air circulation reduces moisture buildup
- Slightly thinner than non-perforated versions
- Good compromise between tackiness and absorption

## Thickness and Layering

Padel rackets come in **one grip size only** (unlike tennis rackets which offer multiple handle sizes). This means overgrips are the primary tool for customizing handle diameter.

### How to Customize Thickness

- **Standard (1 overgrip)**: Adds approximately 0.5mm to the circumference. Suitable for most adult hands
- **Built up (2 overgrips)**: Adds approximately 1.0mm. Good for players with larger hands or who prefer a thicker handle
- **Maximum (3 overgrips)**: Adds approximately 1.5mm. For players who need significant handle build-up

### How Thickness Affects Play

| Handle Size | Effect on Play |
|-------------|---------------|
| **Thinner grip** (no overgrip or thin overgrip) | More wrist mobility, better feel for touch shots, less shock absorption |
| **Standard grip** (1 overgrip) | Balanced comfort and control for most players |
| **Thicker grip** (2-3 overgrips) | More stability, reduced vibration, less wrist freedom, better for power players |

**General rule:** Use the thinnest grip that feels comfortable and secure. A grip that's too thick restricts wrist movement, which is essential for padel's varied shot selection.

## How Often to Change Your Overgrip

### By Playing Frequency

| Frequency | Recommended Change Interval |
|-----------|----------------------------|
| **4+ sessions/week** | Every 1-2 weeks |
| **2-3 sessions/week** | Every 2-4 weeks |
| **1 session/week** | Every 1-2 months |
| **Occasional play** | Every 2-3 months or when grip feels worn |

Wilson's guideline: Change your overgrip **as many times per year as you play per week**. For example, if you play 3 times per week, change at least 3 times per year (though more frequent changes are better).

### Signs It's Time to Replace

- **Slippery feel**: The grip has lost its tackiness or absorption
- **Hardened texture**: The overgrip feels rigid or rough rather than soft and cushioned
- **Visible wear**: Fraying, peeling, thinning, or discoloration
- **Shine**: A glossy appearance where the surface was once matte
- **Reduced confidence**: You find yourself gripping tighter than usual to maintain control

## Application Tips

1. **Start from the bottom**: Begin wrapping at the base of the handle (butt end) and work upward
2. **Slight overlap**: Each wrap should overlap the previous layer by about 3-5mm
3. **Consistent tension**: Apply firm, even tension throughout — too tight makes it thin and uncomfortable; too loose creates bumps
4. **Stretch slightly**: Most overgrips are designed to be stretched gently as you wrap
5. **Secure the end**: Use the provided finishing tape to secure the top, or cut the overgrip at an angle for a clean finish
6. **Replace the wrist strap**: Always ensure the wrist strap passes through the butt cap — it's mandatory in padel

## Key Takeaways

- The base grip provides cushioning and structure; overgrips provide the playing surface you feel
- Tacky overgrips offer better initial control; dry/absorbent overgrips perform better in humid conditions
- Padel rackets have one grip size — use overgrip layering to customize handle diameter
- Change overgrips every 1-4 weeks depending on playing frequency
- Replace immediately when slippery, hard, or visibly worn
- Use the thinnest grip that feels secure to preserve wrist mobility for padel's varied shots
