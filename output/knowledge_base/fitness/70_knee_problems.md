# How to Play Padel with Knee Problems

Knee problems are among the most common complaints for padel players, particularly those over 35 or players who increase their frequency rapidly. The sport's constant lateral movements, sudden direction changes, deep lunges, and explosive jumping place significant demands on the knee joint. The good news is that many players with knee issues can continue playing padel successfully by combining equipment modifications, technique adjustments, targeted strengthening, and appropriate bracing. This guide covers how to manage and play through common knee conditions safely.

## Common Knee Conditions in Padel

### Patellar Tendinopathy (Jumper's Knee)
Pain at the front of the knee, just below the kneecap. Caused by repetitive jumping and landing, particularly during smashes and explosive movements. More common in male players.

### Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome (Runner's Knee)
Dull aching pain around or behind the kneecap. Aggravated by squatting, lunging, and climbing stairs. Often caused by poor tracking of the kneecap due to muscle imbalances.

### Meniscus Issues
Sharp or catching pain inside or outside the knee joint. Can be caused by twisting movements under load, common when pivoting during padel.

### MCL Sprains
Pain on the inner side of the knee. Caused by lateral stress, typically from aggressive lateral movements or awkward landings.

### Osteoarthritis
Gradual onset stiffness and pain, particularly after rest or at the start of activity. More common in older players with previous knee injuries.

## Playing Modifications

### Movement Adjustments
- **Reduce the depth of your split step:** A shallower split step reduces knee flexion load while still maintaining readiness
- **Use smaller, more frequent steps** rather than deep lunges to reach balls
- **Avoid aggressive sliding:** On certain court surfaces, players slide into shots. This places extreme shear force on the knee. Step and plant instead
- **Limit overhead smash jumping:** Hit smashes flat-footed or with a small hop rather than full jumping smashes
- **Play more at the net:** Net positioning requires less explosive movement than baseline defense, reducing overall knee loading

### Technique Adjustments
- **Bend from the hips, not just the knees:** When getting low for shots, use a hip-hinge pattern to share the load between glutes, hamstrings, and quads rather than loading the knees exclusively
- **Avoid deep knee flexion beyond 90 degrees** when possible during play
- **Step into shots rather than lunging:** This distributes impact forces across the whole kinetic chain
- **Communicate with your partner:** Let them cover more court during intense rallies if your knee is flaring up

### Session Management
- **Limit session duration:** Play 60-75 minutes instead of 90-120 minutes
- **Increase recovery time between sessions:** Allow 48 hours rather than 24
- **Avoid back-to-back days** of playing until symptoms improve
- **Warm up thoroughly:** Never skip the warm-up; dedicate extra time to knee-specific mobilization

## Knee Braces and Supports

### Light Support (Prevention and Mild Pain)
- **Compression knee sleeves:** Provide warmth, mild compression, and proprioceptive feedback (awareness of knee position). Good for general knee stiffness and mild patellofemoral pain
- **Brands to consider:** Bauerfeind GenuTrain, Zamst ZK-7, McDavid compression sleeves

### Medium Support (Moderate Pain and Instability)
- **Patellar strap/band:** A strap worn just below the kneecap that redistributes force on the patellar tendon. Specifically designed for patellar tendinopathy
- **Hinged knee braces:** Provide lateral stability while allowing normal bending. Good for MCL issues and general instability

### Heavy Support (Post-Injury or Chronic Issues)
- **Rigid hinged braces:** Limit excessive range of motion and provide maximum stability. Used after significant ligament injuries or meniscus repairs
- **Custom orthotics:** A physiotherapist or orthopedic specialist can recommend custom bracing for complex knee problems

### Brace Selection Tips
- Choose braces with non-slip silicone grips to prevent sliding during padel's lateral movements
- Test the brace during practice before using it in competitive matches
- A brace should feel supportive but not restrict blood flow or cause numbness
- Replace braces when they lose elasticity and compression (typically every 6-12 months)

## Strengthening Exercises

Building strength in the muscles surrounding the knee is the most effective long-term strategy for reducing pain and preventing further damage.

### Quadriceps Strengthening
- **Wall sits:** Hold for 20-45 seconds, 3 sets. Build to 60 seconds. Strengthens quads at knee angles used in padel
- **Terminal knee extensions:** With a resistance band behind the knee, straighten from 30 degrees to full extension. 3x15 per leg
- **Step-ups:** 3x10 per leg on a low step (15-20 cm). Focus on controlled lowering

### Hamstring and Posterior Chain
- **Romanian deadlifts:** 3x10 with light dumbbells. Strengthens the hamstrings to balance quad dominance
- **Hamstring curls:** 3x12 with resistance band or machine
- **Glute bridges:** 3x15. Single-leg progression when ready. Strong glutes reduce medial knee stress

### Hip and Glute Stability
- **Clamshells with band:** 3x15 per side. Strengthens the glute medius, which controls knee alignment during lateral movement
- **Lateral band walks:** 3x10 steps each direction. Critical for preventing knee valgus (inward collapse)
- **Single-leg balance:** Stand on one foot for 30-60 seconds. Progress to unstable surfaces (Bosu ball)

### Mobility Work
- **Quad foam rolling:** 60 seconds per leg, daily
- **IT band foam rolling:** 60 seconds per leg
- **Ankle dorsiflexion mobilization:** Restricted ankle mobility forces the knee to compensate. Stretch daily
- **Hip flexor stretching:** Tight hip flexors alter knee mechanics. Stretch after every session

## When to Stop Playing and Seek Help

- Sharp, sudden pain during a specific movement
- Knee locking or catching (inability to fully straighten or bend)
- Significant swelling that does not resolve within 24-48 hours
- Instability or the knee "giving way" during movement
- Pain that worsens progressively over several weeks despite modifications
- Inability to walk normally after playing

## Key Takeaways

- Most knee problems in padel are manageable with proper modifications, bracing, and strengthening
- Reducing lunge depth, limiting jump smashes, and playing more at the net are the most effective immediate modifications
- Knee braces and compression sleeves provide support but do not replace strengthening exercises
- Quadricep, hamstring, and glute strengthening is the most effective long-term treatment for padel-related knee pain
- Listen to your body: persistent or worsening symptoms require professional evaluation from a sports physiotherapist or orthopedic specialist
