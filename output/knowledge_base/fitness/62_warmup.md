# Padel-Specific Warm-Up Routine

A proper warm-up is one of the most effective injury prevention tools in padel. Skipping it is the single most common mistake recreational players make. A padel-specific warm-up should last 10-15 minutes and progress through four phases: general cardio, dynamic stretching, muscle activation, and sport-specific movement drills. The goal is to raise core body temperature, activate the nervous system, lubricate joints, and prime key muscle groups for the explosive demands of play.

## Phase 1: General Cardiovascular Warm-Up (3-5 Minutes)

The first phase elevates heart rate and increases blood flow to muscles. Keep movements light and rhythmic.

- **Light jogging** around or along the court (2-3 minutes)
- **High knees** for 30 seconds to engage hip flexors and core
- **Butt kicks** for 30 seconds to warm the hamstrings and quadriceps
- **Side shuffles** for 30 seconds each direction, mimicking lateral court movement
- **Jumping jacks or skipping rope** for general cardiovascular activation

Start at about 40% effort and gradually increase to 60%.

## Phase 2: Dynamic Stretching and Mobility (5-7 Minutes)

Dynamic stretches use controlled movement to increase range of motion. Never hold static stretches before a match, as research shows they can temporarily reduce muscle power output and responsiveness.

### Lower Body
- **Leg swings (forward/backward):** 10 per leg, gradually increasing range of motion
- **Leg swings (lateral):** 10 per leg, opening the hips
- **Walking lunges with rotation:** 8-10 per side, rotating the torso over the front knee
- **Hip circles:** 10 per leg, standing on one foot and rotating the opposite knee in circles
- **Ankle circles:** 10 per foot in each direction, essential for sprain prevention

### Upper Body
- **Arm circles:** 10 small, 10 large in each direction
- **Shoulder crossovers:** 10 reps, alternating arms across the chest dynamically
- **Torso twists:** 10 reps, standing with arms extended and rotating through the core
- **Wrist circles and flexion/extension:** 10 per wrist, critical for grip preparation

## Phase 3: Muscle Activation (2-3 Minutes)

This phase engages the specific muscle groups that padel demands most: glutes, core, shoulders, and forearms.

- **Bodyweight squats:** 10-15 reps to activate quads, glutes, and core
- **Lateral band walks** (if available): 10 steps each direction for glute medius activation
- **Plank with shoulder taps:** 20-30 seconds to engage core and shoulder stabilizers
- **Forearm squeezes:** 10-15 reps with a soft ball or by clenching and releasing the fist to warm grip muscles
- **Mini lateral lunges:** 8 per side, staying low and controlled

## Phase 4: Padel-Specific Movement Drills (2-5 Minutes)

The final phase connects the warm-up to actual match demands. Perform these on the court.

- **Split steps:** Practice the ready position split step 10-15 times, landing softly on the balls of your feet
- **Shadow strokes:** Mimic forehand, backhand, volleys, and smash movements at 50-60% intensity
- **Short sprints:** 3-4 explosive 5-meter sprints, simulating court coverage
- **Wall mini-rallies:** Hit gentle shots against the back glass at low intensity to warm the arm and calibrate timing
- **Lateral court shuffles:** Move from sideline to sideline in a defensive stance, 5-6 reps

## Common Warm-Up Mistakes to Avoid

- **Static stretching before play:** Save held stretches for after the match
- **Skipping the warm-up entirely:** Even 5 minutes is better than nothing
- **Going too hard too fast:** The warm-up should be progressive, not exhausting
- **Ignoring the upper body:** Padel demands shoulders, wrists, and forearms as much as legs
- **Rushing to rallying:** Hitting hard shots before your body is ready increases injury risk

## Key Takeaways

- A complete padel warm-up takes 10-15 minutes and progresses through four distinct phases
- Dynamic stretching is always preferable to static stretching before play
- Focus on padel-specific movements: lateral shuffles, split steps, rotational movements, and wrist preparation
- Even a brief warm-up significantly reduces injury risk to shoulders, elbows, knees, and ankles
- Consistency matters: warm up before every single session, not just competitive matches
