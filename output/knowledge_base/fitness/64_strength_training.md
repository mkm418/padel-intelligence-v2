# Strength Training Program for Padel Players

Padel demands a unique combination of explosive power, rotational strength, lateral agility, and endurance. Unlike tennis, padel is played on a smaller court with walls, requiring shorter sprints, more frequent direction changes, constant low-stance positioning, and powerful overhead smashes. A well-structured strength program addresses these specific demands while building resilience against the sport's most common injuries: padel elbow, shoulder tendinitis, knee problems, and lower back strain.

## Why Strength Training Matters for Padel

- **Power generation:** Stronger legs and core produce more explosive smashes, faster court coverage, and harder drives
- **Injury resistance:** Strengthened tendons, ligaments, and muscles around vulnerable joints (elbow, shoulder, knee) dramatically reduce injury rates
- **Endurance under fatigue:** Muscular endurance prevents technique breakdown in the third set when fatigue sets in
- **Stability and balance:** Core and hip strength improve recovery after off-balance shots and lunges to the glass

## Program Structure

**Frequency:** 2-3 sessions per week on non-padel days or at least 4-6 hours before/after playing

**Session Duration:** 40-55 minutes

**Periodization:**
- **Pre-season (6-8 weeks):** Focus on building base strength and hypertrophy
- **In-season:** Maintain strength with lower volume, higher intensity, and sport-specific movements
- **Off-season:** Address weaknesses, rehabilitate minor injuries, build general fitness

## Essential Exercises by Category

### Lower Body (Power and Stability)

Lower body strength is the engine of padel movement. Every split step, lunge, and explosive push comes from the legs.

- **Goblet squats or barbell back squats:** 3x8-10. Builds quad, glute, and core strength for crouching and pushing
- **Bulgarian split squats:** 3x8 per leg. Develops single-leg stability crucial for lunges and recovery movements
- **Lateral lunges:** 3x10 per side. Mirrors the lateral movement patterns of padel
- **Romanian deadlifts:** 3x10. Strengthens hamstrings and posterior chain for deceleration
- **Box jumps or jump squats:** 3x6-8. Develops explosive power for smashes and fast court coverage
- **Calf raises:** 3x15. Supports ankle stability and push-off power

### Core (Rotational Strength)

The core transfers power from the lower body to the racket arm and stabilizes the spine during rotational strokes.

- **Pallof press:** 3x10 per side. Anti-rotation strength for controlled shot-making
- **Cable or band woodchops:** 3x12 per side. Mirrors the rotational pattern of forehands and backhands
- **Plank variations (front, side, dynamic):** 3x30-45 seconds. General core endurance
- **Russian twists with medicine ball:** 3x20 total. Rotational endurance
- **Dead bugs:** 3x10 per side. Core stability with controlled limb movement
- **Bird dogs:** 3x10 per side. Spinal stability and coordination

### Upper Body (Functional Strength)

Upper body work should prioritize shoulder health, forearm endurance, and push/pull balance.

- **Push-ups (standard and incline):** 3x12-15. Chest, shoulder, and tricep endurance
- **Dumbbell shoulder press:** 3x10. Overhead pressing strength for smashes
- **Bent-over rows:** 3x10. Back strength and postural balance to counteract forward-dominant padel posture
- **External rotations with resistance band:** 3x15 per arm. Rotator cuff health and injury prevention
- **Wrist curls and reverse wrist curls:** 3x15. Forearm strength to prevent padel elbow
- **Face pulls:** 3x12-15. Rear deltoid and scapular stabilizer strength

### Agility Finishers (5-10 Minutes)

End each session with agility work to bridge gym strength with court performance.

- **Lateral shuffle drill:** 3x20 seconds with 15-second rest
- **Agility ladder patterns:** 2-3 minutes of varied footwork
- **Reaction ball or wall throws:** 2 minutes for hand-eye coordination
- **Short sprint intervals:** 4-6 x 10-meter sprints with full recovery

## Sample Weekly Schedule

| Day | Activity |
|-----|----------|
| Monday | Padel match/practice |
| Tuesday | Strength session A (lower body + core focus) |
| Wednesday | Padel match/practice |
| Thursday | Strength session B (upper body + agility focus) |
| Friday | Rest or light mobility/yoga |
| Saturday | Padel match/tournament |
| Sunday | Active recovery (walking, swimming, stretching) |

## Key Takeaways

- Padel-specific strength training prioritizes core rotation, single-leg stability, shoulder health, and forearm resilience
- Train 2-3 times per week on non-padel days with sessions of 40-55 minutes
- Lower body and core are more important than upper body for on-court performance
- Forearm and rotator cuff exercises are essential injury prevention, not optional accessories
- Periodize training across the season: build in pre-season, maintain in-season, recover in off-season
