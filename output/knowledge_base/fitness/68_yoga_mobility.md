# Padel-Specific Yoga and Mobility Routine

Padel's demanding movement repertoire, including lateral shuffles, explosive lunges, overhead smashes, deep crouches, and rapid rotations, creates significant tightness and imbalances in the hips, shoulders, lower back, and ankles. A regular yoga and mobility routine counteracts these patterns by improving range of motion, building stability through end ranges, and maintaining the functional flexibility needed to perform at your best while avoiding injury.

## Why Mobility Matters for Padel

- **Hip flexibility** enables deeper lunges and wider lateral reaches without straining the groin or knees
- **Shoulder mobility** allows full overhead range for smashes and prevents impingement
- **Thoracic spine rotation** powers forehands and backhands through the core rather than the arm
- **Ankle mobility** supports proper squat depth for low volleys and reduces sprain risk
- **Lower back health** depends on hip and thoracic flexibility; when these are restricted, the lumbar spine compensates with damaging rotational stress

## Pre-Match Dynamic Mobility (5-7 Minutes)

Perform these before playing as part of your warm-up. Move through each position fluidly without holding static stretches.

- **World's Greatest Stretch:** Step into a deep lunge, place the same-side hand on the ground, rotate the opposite hand to the sky, hold 2 seconds, repeat 5 per side. Targets hips, hamstrings, thoracic spine, and shoulders simultaneously
- **Leg swings (sagittal):** 10 per leg, forward and backward with progressively increasing range
- **Leg swings (frontal):** 10 per leg, side to side across the body
- **Arm circles to shoulder pass-throughs:** 10 circles each direction, then 10 pass-throughs with a resistance band or towel
- **Hip circles (standing):** 10 per leg, large controlled circles with the knee driving outward
- **Ankle dorsiflexion mobilization:** Step one foot forward against a wall, drive the knee over the toes while keeping the heel down, 10 reps per ankle

## Key Yoga Poses for Padel Players

Hold each pose for 5-8 breaths (approximately 30-45 seconds). Focus on controlled breathing: inhale through the nose for 4 counts, exhale through the nose for 6 counts.

### Hip Openers
- **Warrior II (Virabhadrasana II):** Builds leg strength while opening the hips and inner thighs. Essential for the wide stance required in padel defense
- **Lizard Pose (Utthan Pristhasana):** Deep hip flexor and quad stretch. Addresses the tightness created by constant lunging on court
- **Pigeon Pose (Eka Pada Rajakapotasana):** Deep glute and external hip rotation stretch. Counteracts the internal rotation patterns from lateral shuffling
- **90/90 Hip Rotations:** Sit with both legs at 90-degree angles, rotate between internal and external hip positions. Develops the hip rotation range needed for court movement

### Shoulder and Upper Body
- **Thread the Needle:** From all fours, thread one arm under the body and rotate the thoracic spine. Improves the rotational range for groundstrokes
- **Eagle Arms (Garudasana arms):** Cross the arms and lift elbows to shoulder height. Stretches the upper back and rear shoulders
- **Cow Face Arms (Gomukhasana arms):** One arm overhead reaching down the back, the other behind the back reaching up. Tests and improves shoulder rotation range in both directions
- **Puppy Pose (Uttana Shishosana):** Extended child's pose with arms stretched forward. Deep shoulder flexion and thoracic extension stretch

### Spine and Core
- **Cat-Cow (Marjaryasana-Bitilasana):** 10 slow repetitions. Warms the spine through flexion and extension, mobilizes the vertebral segments
- **Downward-Facing Dog (Adho Mukha Svanasana):** Full-body stretch targeting hamstrings, calves, shoulders, and spine. Hold 5-8 breaths
- **Supine Twist:** Lying on the back, drop both knees to one side while keeping shoulders grounded. Hold 30-45 seconds per side. Releases lower back and improves thoracic rotation

### Lower Body
- **Low Lunge (Anjaneyasana):** Deep hip flexor stretch with an upright torso. Add a quad stretch by bending the back knee and holding the foot
- **Standing Forward Fold (Uttanasana):** Hamstring and lower back release. Let gravity do the work; avoid forcing the stretch
- **Reclined Hand-to-Big-Toe (Supta Padangusthasana):** Hamstring stretch with the back supported on the ground. Use a strap if needed

## Post-Match Static Stretching Routine (10-15 Minutes)

After playing, perform these stretches while muscles are warm. Hold each for 20-30 seconds.

1. Standing quad stretch (each leg)
2. Seated hamstring stretch (each leg)
3. Hip flexor kneeling lunge (each side)
4. Cross-body shoulder stretch (each arm)
5. Wrist extensor and flexor stretches (each arm)
6. Seated spinal twist (each side)
7. Figure-four glute stretch (each side)
8. Child's pose with arms extended (full body release)

## Weekly Mobility Schedule

| Day | Mobility Work |
|-----|--------------|
| Playing days | 5-7 min dynamic mobility pre-match + 10-15 min static stretching post-match |
| Non-playing days | 20-30 min dedicated yoga/mobility session |
| Rest days | 15-20 min gentle restorative yoga or foam rolling |

## Key Takeaways

- Mobility work is not optional for padel players; it directly affects performance and injury risk
- The hips, shoulders, and thoracic spine are the three most important mobility areas for padel
- Dynamic mobility before playing, static stretching after playing, and dedicated yoga sessions on off-days form a complete flexibility program
- Consistency beats intensity: 15-20 minutes of daily mobility work produces better results than one long weekly session
- Yoga improves not just flexibility but also body awareness, breathing control, and mental focus, all of which transfer directly to court performance
