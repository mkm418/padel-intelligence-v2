# Padel Elbow: Prevention, Treatment, and Technique Adjustments

Padel elbow, clinically known as lateral epicondylitis, is the single most diagnosed injury in padel. It involves inflammation and micro-tearing of the tendons that attach to the lateral epicondyle, the bony bump on the outside of the elbow. Research shows an incidence of approximately 3 injuries per 1,000 training hours and 8 per 1,000 match hours, making it a condition that virtually every regular player needs to understand and proactively prevent.

## Understanding the Condition

Lateral epicondylitis develops from repetitive stress on the forearm extensor tendons, the muscles responsible for wrist extension and grip strength. In padel, these tendons are loaded with every stroke, particularly during:

- **Backhand shots:** The wrist extensors work hardest during the backhand, especially if technique relies on wrist flicking rather than body rotation
- **Volleys at the net:** Rapid wrist adjustments under impact create repeated microtrauma
- **Gripping the racket:** Sustained tight grip throughout long rallies fatigues the forearm
- **Vibration transfer:** Impact shock traveling from the racket into the forearm with each hit

## Risk Factors

- Playing more than 3 times per week without adequate conditioning
- Using a racket that is too heavy, too stiff, or transfers excessive vibration
- Incorrect grip size (too small forces over-gripping; too large strains the extensors)
- Poor backhand technique relying on wrist power instead of shoulder and core rotation
- Sudden increase in playing volume or intensity
- Weak forearm and grip muscles
- Age over 35 (tendon elasticity decreases with age)

## Prevention Strategies

### Equipment Adjustments
- **Racket selection:** Choose a racket with a soft EVA or foam core that dampens vibration. Avoid very stiff, carbon-heavy rackets if you are prone to elbow issues
- **Grip size:** Your grip should allow a small finger-width gap between your fingertips and palm. When in doubt, go slightly larger
- **Vibration dampeners:** Use overgrips or anti-vibration technology built into the racket
- **String tension:** Lower tension reduces impact shock

### Technique Corrections
- **Use your whole body on backhands:** Rotate from the hips and shoulders, not just the wrist and forearm
- **Relax the grip between shots:** Maintain a loose grip at 3-4/10 intensity and only tighten to 7-8/10 at the moment of contact
- **Continental grip for volleys:** Ensures the wrist stays in a neutral, less-strained position
- **Avoid wrist flicks:** Let the racket head do the work with proper swing mechanics

### Conditioning Exercises (Preventive)
- **Wrist curls and reverse wrist curls:** 3 sets of 15 reps with a light dumbbell (1-3 kg), 3 times per week
- **Eccentric wrist extensions:** Slowly lower a light weight from wrist extension to flexion over 3-4 seconds, 3 sets of 12
- **Forearm pronation/supination:** Rotate a hammer or weighted bar from palm-up to palm-down, 3 sets of 12
- **Grip strengthening:** Squeeze a stress ball or use a hand gripper for 3 sets of 20
- **Theraband FlexBar Tyler Twist:** A specific eccentric exercise shown to be highly effective for lateral epicondylitis prevention and treatment

## Treatment Protocols

### Acute Phase (First 1-2 Weeks)
- **Rest from aggravating activities:** Reduce or stop padel temporarily
- **Ice application:** 15-20 minutes, 3-4 times daily on the lateral elbow
- **NSAIDs:** Anti-inflammatory medication (ibuprofen) as directed for pain and swelling
- **Compression:** An epicondylitis strap or counterforce brace worn just below the elbow to offload the tendon

### Rehabilitation Phase (Weeks 2-8)
- **Progressive loading:** Begin eccentric strengthening exercises under physiotherapist guidance
- **Forearm stretches:** Extend the arm straight, pull the wrist down gently with the opposite hand, hold 30 seconds, repeat 3-5 times. Perform 2-3 times daily
- **Massage and soft tissue work:** Cross-friction massage on the tendon to promote blood flow and healing
- **Gradual return to play:** Start with gentle wall rallies at 50% effort, increasing over 2-3 weeks

### Persistent Cases (Beyond 8 Weeks)
- **Physiotherapy:** Structured rehabilitation program with manual therapy
- **Shockwave therapy:** Extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) has shown effectiveness for chronic cases
- **PRP injections:** Platelet-rich plasma therapy for cases unresponsive to conservative treatment
- **Technique analysis:** Video analysis of stroke mechanics to identify and correct biomechanical faults

## Bracing and Support Options

- **Epicondylitis counterforce strap:** Worn 2-3 cm below the elbow joint; redistributes forces away from the damaged tendon. Best for mild to moderate cases during play
- **Kinesiology tape:** Applied in specific patterns to support the forearm extensors without restricting movement
- **Full elbow sleeve:** Provides compression and warmth for chronic conditions
- **Note:** Braces manage symptoms but do not fix the underlying cause. Always combine with strengthening and technique work

## Key Takeaways

- Padel elbow is the most common injury in the sport and is almost entirely preventable with proper equipment, technique, and conditioning
- The backhand stroke is the primary culprit; learning to rotate from the body rather than flick the wrist is the most important technique change
- Eccentric forearm exercises are the gold standard for both prevention and treatment
- Equipment matters: grip size, racket stiffness, and vibration dampening directly affect elbow stress
- Mild cases heal in 4-6 weeks; chronic cases may take 3-6 months. Early intervention is critical
