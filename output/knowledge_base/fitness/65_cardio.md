# Cardio and Endurance Training for Competitive Padel

Padel is an intermittent sport that demands repeated bursts of high-intensity effort separated by brief recovery periods. Competitive matches can last 60-120 minutes, with rallies averaging 8-15 seconds followed by 10-20 seconds of rest. This work-rest profile requires a well-developed aerobic base for recovery between points and strong anaerobic capacity for explosive movements during rallies. Research shows that heart rate during padel matches fluctuates significantly, with players frequently reaching 85-95% of maximum heart rate during intense rallies.

## Understanding Padel's Physiological Demands

- **Average heart rate during match:** 70-85% of HRmax
- **Peak heart rate during rallies:** 85-95% of HRmax
- **Calorie expenditure:** 400-600 calories per hour
- **Movement pattern:** Intermittent with frequent direction changes, short sprints (3-7 meters), and lateral shuffling
- **Energy system demands:** Approximately 60-70% aerobic, 30-40% anaerobic

## HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training)

HIIT closely mimics the intermittent demands of competitive padel and is the most efficient training method for improving both aerobic and anaerobic capacity.

### Off-Court HIIT Protocols

**Protocol 1: Sprint Intervals**
- 30 seconds all-out sprint / 30 seconds walk recovery
- 8-12 rounds (8-12 minutes total)
- Perform on a track, treadmill, or bike

**Protocol 2: Tabata-Style**
- 20 seconds maximum effort / 10 seconds rest
- 8 rounds (4 minutes) per exercise
- Exercises: burpees, mountain climbers, squat jumps, shuttle runs
- 2-3 circuits with 2 minutes rest between

**Protocol 3: 30-15 Intermittent Fitness Test (30-15IFT) Protocol**
- 30 seconds of running at progressively increasing speeds / 15 seconds of passive recovery
- Research has validated this protocol specifically for padel fitness assessment and training

### On-Court HIIT Protocols

Research demonstrates that on-court interval training produces equivalent cardiovascular and metabolic responses to off-court running intervals, while also developing sport-specific movement patterns and technical skills.

**Protocol 1: Rally Simulation**
- Play high-intensity rallies for 20-30 seconds with partner
- 15-20 seconds rest between rallies
- 10-15 rounds per set, 2-3 sets
- Focus on maintaining aggressive movement and shot quality

**Protocol 2: Movement Pattern Intervals**
- Split step + sprint to net + recovery jog back (repeat)
- 30 seconds work / 15 seconds rest
- 8-10 rounds
- Vary patterns: lateral shuffles, diagonal sprints, approach-retreat

**Protocol 3: Integrated Technical HIIT**
- Combine neuromuscular exercises (lunges, jumps) with sport-specific shots
- An 8-week integrated training study showed greater improvements in padel-specific performance, stroke velocity, and change-of-direction ability compared to off-court-only training

## Steady-State Aerobic Training

While HIIT is more time-efficient, steady-state aerobic work builds the cardiovascular base that supports recovery between points, sets, and matches.

### When to Use Steady State
- **Building an aerobic base** in pre-season or for beginners new to fitness training
- **Active recovery days** between intense padel or HIIT sessions
- **Tournament weeks** when you want to maintain fitness without adding fatigue

### Recommended Steady-State Activities
- **Jogging:** 30-45 minutes at 60-70% HRmax, 1-2 times per week
- **Cycling:** 40-60 minutes at moderate intensity, low-impact alternative
- **Swimming:** 30-45 minutes, excellent for recovery and shoulder mobility
- **Brisk walking:** 45-60 minutes on rest days for active recovery

## Recommended Weekly Cardio Plan

| Session Type | Frequency | Duration | Intensity |
|-------------|-----------|----------|-----------|
| On-court HIIT | 1-2x/week | 20-30 min | 85-95% HRmax |
| Off-court HIIT | 1x/week | 15-25 min | 85-95% HRmax |
| Steady-state aerobic | 1-2x/week | 30-45 min | 60-70% HRmax |
| Padel match play | 2-3x/week | 60-90 min | Variable |

## On-Court vs. Off-Court: The Evidence

A key finding from racket sports research is that on-court interval training elicits heart rate responses (95.9% vs. 96.1% HRmax), blood lactate levels, and perceived exertion virtually identical to traditional running intervals. This means:

- On-court training is a valid and time-efficient alternative to gym cardio
- It develops sport-specific fitness, movement patterns, and technical skills simultaneously
- Integrated training (combining physical and technical work on court) produces superior padel-specific results
- Off-court training remains valuable for variety, injury prevention, and building raw aerobic capacity

## Key Takeaways

- Padel is primarily aerobic (60-70%) with significant anaerobic demands during rallies
- HIIT is the most padel-specific and time-efficient cardio training method
- On-court HIIT produces equivalent physiological responses to off-court running intervals with added technical benefits
- Steady-state aerobic training supports recovery and builds the base for HIIT performance
- A balanced program includes 2-3 HIIT sessions and 1-2 steady-state sessions per week alongside match play
