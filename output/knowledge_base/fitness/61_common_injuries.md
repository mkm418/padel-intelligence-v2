# Most Common Padel Injuries: Causes, Prevention, and Recovery

Padel is an accessible and social sport, but its explosive movements, repetitive strokes, and confined court dimensions create specific injury risks. Research shows that 40-95% of regular padel players experience injuries at some point, with approximately 53.8% of amateur players reporting injuries within any given six-month period. Understanding the most common injury sites, their causes, and how to prevent and recover from them is essential for long-term enjoyment of the sport.

## Elbow Injuries

The elbow is the single most common injury site in padel, accounting for roughly 20% of all padel-related injuries. The incidence rate is approximately 3 injuries per 1,000 training hours and 8 per 1,000 match hours.

- **Lateral epicondylitis (padel/tennis elbow):** Inflammation of the tendons on the outer elbow caused by repetitive wrist extension during backhands and volleys
- **Extensor tendinopathy:** Chronic overuse of the forearm extensor muscles from repeated gripping and striking
- **Causes:** Poor backhand technique, incorrect grip size, stiff rackets with high vibration, sudden increases in play frequency

## Shoulder Injuries

Overhead motions, particularly the smash, place significant stress on the shoulder joint and rotator cuff.

- **Rotator cuff tendinitis:** Inflammation from repeated overhead movements
- **Shoulder impingement:** Compression of tendons between shoulder bones during smashes and high volleys
- **Causes:** Excessive smashing without adequate shoulder conditioning, poor warm-up, weak stabilizer muscles

## Knee Injuries

Padel demands constant direction changes, explosive lunges, and sudden stops that load the knee joint heavily.

- **Patellar tendinopathy (jumper's knee):** Overuse injury of the tendon connecting the kneecap to the shinbone, more common in male players
- **Meniscus damage:** Tears caused by deep squatting and twisting under load
- **MCL sprains:** Medial collateral ligament injuries from lateral pivoting movements
- **Causes:** Weak quadriceps and hamstrings, poor landing mechanics, playing on hard surfaces without proper footwear

## Ankle and Foot Injuries

The ankle-foot region is one of the most frequently injured areas, primarily due to rapid direction changes on a small court.

- **Lateral ankle sprains:** Ligament overstretching or tearing when the foot rolls inward during quick lateral movements
- **Achilles tendinopathy:** Gradual overuse of the Achilles tendon from repeated push-off movements
- **Causes:** Inadequate footwear, poor ankle stability, playing on wet or slippery surfaces, fatigue

## Lower Back and Core

- **Lumbar muscle strains:** Caused by rotational forces during strokes and overhead shots
- **Disc issues:** Less common but possible from repeated twisting under load
- **Causes:** Weak core muscles, poor rotational mechanics, insufficient warm-up

## Recovery Timelines

| Injury | Mild | Moderate | Severe |
|--------|------|----------|--------|
| Lateral epicondylitis | 2-4 weeks | 4-8 weeks | 3-6 months |
| Rotator cuff tendinitis | 2-4 weeks | 6-8 weeks | 3-4 months |
| Patellar tendinopathy | 2-4 weeks | 6-12 weeks | 3-6 months |
| Ankle sprain (Grade I-III) | 1-2 weeks | 4-6 weeks | 8-12 weeks |
| Lumbar strain | 1-2 weeks | 4-6 weeks | 8-12 weeks |

## Prevention Strategies

- **Warm up properly** before every session with dynamic stretches focusing on shoulders, wrists, hips, and ankles
- **Strengthen vulnerable areas** with targeted exercises for forearms, rotator cuff, quadriceps, and ankle stabilizers
- **Use appropriate equipment:** correctly sized grip, shock-absorbing racket, padel-specific shoes with lateral support
- **Progress gradually:** avoid sudden increases in playing frequency or intensity
- **Cool down and stretch** after every match, focusing on tight areas
- **Listen to your body:** persistent pain is a signal to rest, not play through
- **Stay hydrated** and maintain adequate nutrition to support tissue health

## Key Takeaways

- The elbow, knee, shoulder, and ankle are the four most commonly injured areas in padel
- Tendon injuries (tendinopathies) are the most prevalent injury type overall
- Most padel injuries are overuse injuries that develop gradually rather than acute traumatic events
- Prevention through proper warm-up, strength training, correct technique, and appropriate equipment is far more effective than treatment
- Early intervention and rest are critical; playing through pain typically worsens the condition and extends recovery
