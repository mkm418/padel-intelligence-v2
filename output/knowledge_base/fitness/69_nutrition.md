# Nutrition Guide for Padel Players

Proper nutrition is a performance multiplier in padel. The sport burns 400-600 calories per hour through a combination of explosive sprints, sustained rallies, and constant court movement. Matches can last 60-120 minutes, requiring steady energy from start to finish. What you eat before, during, and after playing directly impacts your energy levels, reaction time, endurance, recovery speed, and long-term health. This guide provides practical, evidence-based nutrition strategies for every phase of a padel session.

## Pre-Match Nutrition

The goal of pre-match eating is to fill glycogen stores, maintain stable blood sugar during play, and avoid digestive discomfort during the explosive movements of padel.

### Timing Guidelines
- **Full meal:** 2-3 hours before play
- **Light snack:** 1-1.5 hours before play
- **Nothing heavy:** Within 60 minutes of match time

### What to Eat (2-3 Hours Before)
Focus on complex carbohydrates with moderate protein and low fat:

- Whole grain pasta with light tomato sauce and chicken
- Brown rice with grilled fish and vegetables
- Oatmeal with banana, honey, and a scoop of protein powder
- Toast with eggs and avocado
- Sweet potato with lean turkey and greens

### Light Snack Options (1-1.5 Hours Before)
- Banana with a tablespoon of peanut butter
- Small handful of trail mix (nuts, dried fruit)
- Rice cakes with honey
- Energy bar with natural ingredients
- Greek yogurt with berries

### What to Avoid Before Playing
- **High-fat meals** (fried food, heavy cheese, creamy sauces) slow digestion and cause sluggishness
- **High-fiber foods** (beans, raw broccoli, bran cereal) can cause bloating and cramping during play
- **Large portions** of any food within 90 minutes of match time
- **Sugary drinks and candy** that cause energy spikes followed by crashes
- **New or unfamiliar foods** on match day; stick to what your stomach knows

### Pre-Match Hydration
- Drink 400-500ml of water 2-3 hours before the match
- Sip an additional 200-300ml one hour before play
- Urine should be pale yellow at match time

## During-Match Fueling

For matches under 60 minutes, water alone is typically sufficient. For longer matches, back-to-back games, or tournaments, strategic fueling prevents energy crashes in later sets.

### Hydration During Play
- **Drink 150-250ml of water** at every changeover (approximately every 10-15 minutes)
- **Electrolyte drinks** for matches over 60 minutes or in hot conditions to replace sodium, potassium, and magnesium lost through sweat
- **Avoid overly sugary sports drinks;** dilute them 50/50 with water if they are your only option

### Between-Set and Mid-Match Snacks
- Half a banana for quick natural energy
- 2-3 dates or a small handful of raisins
- Small energy gel or energy chew
- A few bites of an energy bar
- Orange slices for hydration and quick carbohydrates

### Signs You Need to Fuel
- Difficulty concentrating or making decisions
- Legs feeling heavy or unresponsive
- Increased unforced errors in the second or third set
- Dizziness or lightheadedness

## Post-Match Recovery Nutrition

Recovery nutrition has two windows: the immediate 30-minute window for jump-starting repair and the 1-2 hour window for a complete recovery meal.

### Within 30 Minutes (Recovery Snack)
The body is most receptive to nutrient absorption immediately after exercise. A quick protein-plus-carb snack accelerates recovery:

- Protein shake with banana
- Greek yogurt with granola
- Chocolate milk (surprisingly effective; combines carbs, protein, and electrolytes)
- Protein bar with 15-20g protein
- Handful of nuts with dried fruit

### Within 1-2 Hours (Full Recovery Meal)
Aim for a balanced plate with these proportions:

- **Carbohydrates (50-60%):** Rice, pasta, potatoes, quinoa, or bread to replenish glycogen stores
- **Protein (25-30%):** 20-30g from chicken, fish, eggs, tofu, lentils, or Greek yogurt for muscle repair
- **Healthy fats (15-20%):** Olive oil, avocado, nuts, or fatty fish for anti-inflammatory support
- **Vegetables and fruits:** Leafy greens, berries, tomatoes for vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants

### Top Recovery Meal Examples
- Grilled salmon with rice, steamed vegetables, and avocado
- Chicken stir-fry with brown rice and mixed vegetables
- Tuna wrap with salad and hummus
- Scrambled eggs on whole-grain toast with spinach and tomato
- Lentil soup with crusty bread and a side salad

### Anti-Inflammatory Foods to Include Regularly
- **Berries** (blueberries, strawberries, cherries) rich in antioxidants
- **Fatty fish** (salmon, mackerel, sardines) high in omega-3 fatty acids
- **Turmeric and ginger** with natural anti-inflammatory properties
- **Leafy greens** (spinach, kale) packed with vitamins and minerals
- **Nuts** (almonds, walnuts) for healthy fats and vitamin E

### Post-Match Rehydration
- Drink 400-500ml of water immediately after the match
- Continue hydrating over the next 2-3 hours
- Weigh yourself before and after play: drink 1.5 liters for every kilogram of body weight lost
- Add electrolytes if you sweated heavily or played in heat

## Tournament Day Nutrition

Tournament days with multiple matches require special planning:

- Pack all food and drinks the night before
- Eat a substantial breakfast 3 hours before the first match
- Between matches: focus on easily digestible carbs and moderate protein
- Avoid heavy restaurant meals between games
- Keep hydrating consistently throughout the day
- Bring backup snacks: energy bars, bananas, nuts, dried fruit

## Key Takeaways

- Eat a carb-focused meal with moderate protein 2-3 hours before playing
- Hydrate consistently before, during, and after matches with water and electrolytes
- For matches over 60 minutes, fuel during play with easily digestible carbs like bananas or energy gels
- Eat a recovery snack within 30 minutes and a balanced meal within 1-2 hours after playing
- Include anti-inflammatory foods regularly to support recovery and joint health
- Avoid experimenting with new foods on match day
