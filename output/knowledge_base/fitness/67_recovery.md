# Recovery Protocols After Padel Matches

What you do in the hours after a padel match significantly impacts how quickly your body repairs, how you feel for your next session, and your long-term injury risk. Padel burns 400-600 calories per hour, depletes glycogen stores, causes micro-tears in muscle fibers, and creates inflammation in stressed tendons and joints. A structured recovery protocol addresses all of these factors systematically.

## Immediate Post-Match Cooldown (5-10 Minutes)

Begin recovery the moment the match ends. Do not sit down immediately or leave the court without cooling down.

- **Light walking** around the court for 2-3 minutes to gradually lower heart rate
- **Gentle arm and leg shaking** to promote blood flow and begin clearing metabolic waste
- **Deep breathing** with 4-second inhale and 6-second exhale to activate the parasympathetic nervous system and shift from fight-or-flight to recovery mode
- **Gentle shoulder rolls and wrist circles** to release tension in the upper body

## Static Stretching (10-15 Minutes)

After the cooldown, perform static stretches while muscles are still warm. Hold each stretch for 20-30 seconds without bouncing. Focus on the muscle groups most stressed during padel.

### Priority Areas
- **Calves and Achilles:** Wall stretch with straight and bent knee variations
- **Quadriceps:** Standing quad stretch, holding each leg 30 seconds
- **Hamstrings:** Seated forward fold or standing toe touch with slight knee bend
- **Hip flexors:** Kneeling lunge stretch, sinking the hips forward
- **Shoulders:** Cross-body arm stretch and overhead tricep stretch
- **Forearms:** Extended arm with wrist pulled back (extensors) and forward (flexors)
- **Lower back:** Lying knee-to-chest pulls, both single and double leg
- **Glutes:** Figure-four stretch lying on your back

## Foam Rolling and Self-Massage (10-15 Minutes)

Foam rolling (self-myofascial release) breaks up muscle adhesions, improves blood circulation, and reduces delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS).

### Foam Rolling Protocol
- **Quadriceps:** Roll slowly from hip to knee, pausing on tender spots for 20-30 seconds
- **IT band and outer thigh:** Roll from hip to above the knee
- **Calves:** Roll from behind the knee to above the ankle
- **Glutes:** Sit on the roller and roll one glute at a time using a cross-legged position
- **Upper back (thoracic spine):** Roll from mid-back to shoulders with arms crossed over chest
- **Lats:** Lie on your side and roll from armpit to mid-ribcage

### Additional Tools
- **Massage gun:** Use on quads, glutes, calves, and upper traps for 30-60 seconds per area at moderate intensity to increase circulation
- **Lacrosse ball:** Targeted work on forearms, plantar fascia (foot), and glute trigger points
- **Compression boots (if available):** 20-30 minutes of pneumatic compression for enhanced lymphatic drainage

## Nutrition Timing

### Within 30 Minutes Post-Match
- **Quick snack:** Banana with a handful of nuts, protein bar, or Greek yogurt
- **Purpose:** Begin glycogen replenishment and provide amino acids for muscle repair
- **Hydration:** Drink 400-500ml of water immediately

### Within 1-2 Hours Post-Match
- **Balanced meal** combining:
  - **Carbohydrates (50-60%):** Rice, pasta, sweet potatoes, or whole grain bread to restore glycogen
  - **Protein (25-30%):** Chicken, fish, eggs, tofu, or legumes providing 20-30g of protein for muscle repair
  - **Healthy fats (15-20%):** Avocado, olive oil, nuts for anti-inflammatory support
- **Anti-inflammatory foods:** Berries, leafy greens, fatty fish (salmon), turmeric, and ginger to reduce exercise-induced inflammation

### Hydration Protocol
- Drink 400-500ml water in the first 30 minutes
- Continue sipping water throughout the next 2-3 hours
- For intense matches or hot conditions, add electrolytes (sodium, potassium, magnesium) via sports drinks or electrolyte tablets
- Monitor urine color: pale yellow indicates adequate hydration

## Heat and Cold Therapy

- **Ice bath or cold shower (2-5 minutes):** Reduces inflammation and muscle soreness, especially after intense matches or tournaments
- **Infrared sauna or warm bath (15-20 minutes):** Improves blood circulation and promotes muscle relaxation
- **Contrast therapy:** Alternating between cold (1-2 minutes) and warm (3-4 minutes) for 3-4 cycles can be particularly effective for recovery

## Sleep: The Most Important Recovery Tool

Sleep is when the majority of muscle repair, hormone regulation, and neural recovery occurs. It is non-negotiable for padel players.

- **Target 7-9 hours** of quality sleep per night
- **Sleep consistency:** Go to bed and wake up at similar times, even on non-playing days
- **Pre-sleep routine:** Avoid screens 30-60 minutes before bed, keep the room cool (18-20 degrees C) and dark
- **Napping:** A 20-30 minute post-match nap can accelerate recovery if sleep was insufficient the previous night
- **Avoid alcohol:** While tempting after a social padel match, alcohol impairs sleep quality, delays recovery, and increases inflammation

## Active Recovery (Next Day)

On the day after intense matches, perform light activity rather than complete rest.

- 20-30 minutes of light walking, swimming, or cycling
- Gentle yoga or mobility work focusing on tight areas
- Repeat foam rolling on sore muscle groups
- Avoid high-intensity training or competitive play

## Key Takeaways

- Recovery is not passive; it is an active, structured process that begins immediately after the match
- The four pillars of padel recovery are: movement (cooldown and stretching), nutrition (timing and composition), soft tissue work (foam rolling), and sleep
- Eat a balanced meal with carbs and protein within 1-2 hours of playing and rehydrate immediately
- Sleep is the single most powerful recovery tool; prioritize 7-9 hours nightly
- Active recovery (light movement the next day) is superior to complete rest for reducing soreness
