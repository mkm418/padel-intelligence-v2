# Padel Court Lighting Standards: Lux Requirements, LED Options, and How Lighting Affects Gameplay

Proper lighting is essential for safe, enjoyable padel. It affects ball visibility, player comfort, televised broadcast quality, and energy costs. Courts that fall below minimum standards create shadows, glare, and blind spots that frustrate players and increase injury risk. This guide covers the technical standards, practical LED options, and real-world effects of lighting on gameplay.

## Lux Requirements by Standard

Padel court lighting follows the European Standard EN 12193:2008 (Light and Lighting — Sports Lighting). Requirements vary by competition level and whether the court is indoor or outdoor.

### Outdoor Courts

| Level | Minimum Lux | Uniformity Ratio (Emin/Eave) |
|---|---|---|
| International / National competition | 500 lux | 0.7 |
| Regional / Club competition | 300 lux | 0.6 |
| Recreational / Training | 200 lux | 0.5 |

### Indoor Courts

| Level | Minimum Lux | Uniformity Ratio (Emin/Eave) |
|---|---|---|
| International / National competition | 750 lux | 0.7 |
| Regional / Club competition | 500 lux | 0.6 |
| Recreational / Training | 300 lux | 0.5 |

**Uniformity ratio** measures how evenly light is distributed. A ratio of 0.7 means the dimmest point on the court must be at least 70% as bright as the average — critical for eliminating dark spots that hide the ball.

## Key Lighting Parameters Beyond Lux

Getting the lux level right is only part of the equation. Several other parameters determine lighting quality:

### Colour Temperature
- **Recommended range:** 4000K–6000K
- **4000K (neutral white):** Warmer feel, good for recreational clubs
- **5000K–6000K (daylight white):** Crisper visibility, preferred for competition and broadcast
- Players generally perform better under 5000K+ lighting because the cooler tone provides better contrast against white and yellow balls

### Colour Rendering Index (CRI)
- **Minimum:** 80 CRI
- **Preferred:** 90+ CRI for broadcast and professional courts
- CRI measures how accurately colours appear under artificial light. Higher CRI means players, spectators, and cameras see true colours — particularly important for distinguishing ball colour against the turf

### Glare Rating (UGR)
- **Maximum:** UGR 19 or lower
- Glare is the single most common lighting complaint from padel players. It occurs when light sources are visible in the player's field of vision during serves, overhead smashes, and lobs
- Proper luminaire shielding and mounting height are the primary glare controls

### Flicker
- LED fixtures must be flicker-free (less than 1% flicker percentage)
- Flicker causes headaches, eye strain, and can affect high-speed camera footage for broadcast

## LED Fixture Options and Configuration

### Why LED Is Now Standard

LED has almost entirely replaced metal halide (HID) lighting for padel courts. The advantages are decisive:

- **80% lower energy consumption** compared to equivalent metal halide output
- **100,000+ hour lifespan** (vs 6,000–15,000 hours for HID)
- **Instant on/off:** No warm-up period — HID lamps need 5–15 minutes to reach full brightness
- **Better light quality:** Superior uniformity, higher CRI, and no flicker
- **Lower maintenance:** Longer lamp life means fewer replacements and reduced downtime
- **Dimmable:** LED fixtures can be dimmed for energy savings during low-usage periods

### Typical Configuration

A standard single padel court uses the following setup:

- **Number of fixtures:** 8–12 LED floodlights
- **Mounting:** 4 poles positioned approximately 4m from each corner of the court, or wall-mounted for indoor courts
- **Pole height:** 6m minimum (8m recommended for new builds)
- **Fixture power:** 200W–400W per luminaire depending on mounting height and required lux level
- **Total power per court:** 1.6kW–3.2kW

### Cost

| Component | Cost Range |
|---|---|
| LED fixtures (set of 8–12) | €2,000–€5,000 |
| Poles and installation (outdoor) | €1,500–€4,000 |
| Wiring, switchgear, controls | €500–€1,500 |
| **Total per court** | **€4,000–€10,000** |

Premium installations with smart controls (scheduling, dimming, motion sensors) sit at the upper end. Budget recreational setups can be achieved for under €3,000 with basic fixtures.

## How Lighting Affects Gameplay

### Ball Visibility
The ball moves at speeds up to 150 km/h in padel. Players need consistent, shadow-free illumination to track the ball from racket contact through its trajectory, wall bounce, and return. Uneven lighting creates moments where the ball "disappears" in a dark zone — particularly dangerous during fast exchanges at the net.

### Shadows
Improperly placed fixtures cast shadows from the mesh fencing, poles, and player bodies. Shadows on the playing surface confuse depth perception and make it harder to judge ball bounce height. High mounting points and proper fixture spacing minimise shadow formation.

### Glare During Overhead Shots
Serves and smashes require players to look upward directly into the light field. Poor fixture shielding or low mounting heights create blinding glare that makes these shots dangerous. Anti-glare louvers and asymmetric beam optics are essential for player-facing fixtures.

### Player Fatigue
Playing under inadequate or flickering light increases eye strain, leading to faster mental and physical fatigue. Players on well-lit courts report feeling more comfortable and sustaining concentration for longer matches.

### Evening and Night Play
The majority of commercial padel court usage occurs in the evening (18:00–22:00). Lighting quality directly determines whether these peak revenue hours deliver a good player experience. Courts with poor lighting see lower repeat bookings for evening slots.

## Smart Lighting Controls

Modern padel facilities increasingly use intelligent lighting systems:

- **Booking-linked automation:** Lights activate and deactivate based on court reservation times
- **Occupancy sensors:** Detect when courts are in use and adjust brightness accordingly
- **Dimming profiles:** Reduce output to 50% during warm-up or low-traffic periods
- **Energy monitoring:** Track consumption per court for cost management

These systems typically pay for themselves within 2–3 years through energy savings alone.

## Key Takeaways

- Minimum lighting for recreational outdoor padel is 200 lux; competition-grade indoor requires 750 lux with 0.7 uniformity
- LED is the only sensible choice — 80% energy savings, 100,000+ hour lifespan, and instant on/off versus metal halide
- Glare control is as important as brightness — use anti-glare optics and mount fixtures at 6m+ height
- Colour temperature of 5000K–6000K provides the best ball visibility and player comfort
- Budget €4,000–€10,000 per court for a complete LED lighting installation
- Smart controls (booking-linked, dimming, sensors) reduce operating costs and pay back within 2–3 years
