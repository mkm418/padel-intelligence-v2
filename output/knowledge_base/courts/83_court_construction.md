# Padel Court Construction: Dimensions, Materials, Glass Types, Turf Options, and Total Cost Breakdown

Building a padel court is a significant investment that requires careful planning around dimensions, materials, and site preparation. Whether you are adding courts to an existing sports facility or building a standalone venue, understanding each component and its cost will help you budget accurately and avoid costly mistakes.

## Official Court Dimensions

A standard padel court follows strict International Padel Federation (FIP) and ITF regulations:

- **Playing area:** 20m long x 10m wide (200 m²)
- **Net length:** 10m, spanning the full width
- **Net height:** 0.88m at the centre, rising to 0.92m at the posts
- **Back walls:** 4m total height — bottom 3m in glass or solid material, top 1m in metallic mesh
- **Side walls:** 4m total height — back section in glass (varying configurations), front section in mesh
- **Minimum overhead clearance:** 6m (8m recommended for indoor facilities)
- **Run-off area:** Minimum 0.5m on all sides beyond the enclosure

These dimensions are non-negotiable for sanctioned play. Courts that deviate cannot host official tournaments.

## Core Materials

### Steel Structure
The frame is built from galvanized or powder-coated steel, providing the skeleton for glass panels and mesh fencing. Steel must be rated for local wind-load requirements and treated for corrosion resistance, especially in coastal or humid environments. Typical cost: **€4,000–€7,000** per court.

### Tempered Glass
Glass walls are the defining feature of a padel court. Standard specifications require **10mm or 12mm tempered safety glass** (EN 12150 certified). The tempering process heats glass to 620°C then rapidly cools it, increasing impact resistance by approximately 400% compared to regular glass. Upon breakage, tempered glass shatters into small, blunt granules rather than dangerous shards. Typical cost: **€6,000–€10,000** per court.

### Wire Mesh Fencing
The upper portions of the walls and certain side sections use welded steel mesh (50mm x 50mm grid). Mesh must receive anti-corrosion treatment — hot-dip galvanizing is most common. Cost: **€1,500–€3,000** per court.

### Artificial Turf
The playing surface uses FIP/ITF-approved artificial grass with sand infill. Three main fibre types exist (see Topic 85 for details): monofilament, texturized monofilament, and fibrillated. The turf is laid over a porous asphalt or concrete sub-base. Cost: **€2,000–€4,000** per court for the turf alone.

## Foundation and Groundworks

The foundation is often the largest single cost item, consuming 40–50% of the total budget:

- **Concrete slab:** A level, reinforced concrete base (typically 150mm thick) with proper falls for drainage. Cost: **€5,000–€9,000**.
- **Drainage system:** Porous sub-base and perimeter drainage channels to prevent water pooling. Cost: **€800–€2,000**.
- **Site preparation:** Excavation, levelling, and compaction. Costs vary heavily by terrain and access.

## Lighting

LED floodlighting is now standard, mounted on 4 poles at 6–8m height. Recreational courts require a minimum of 200 lux (outdoor) or 300 lux (indoor). Competition courts need 500–750 lux. Cost: **€1,800–€8,000** depending on specification.

## Total Cost Breakdown (2025–2026)

| Court Type | Europe (€) | UK (£) |
|---|---|---|
| Entry-level outdoor | €18,000–€25,000 | £35,000–£40,000 |
| Standard outdoor | €25,000–€35,000 | £50,000–£80,000 |
| Panoramic / indoor | €40,000–€60,000 | £80,000–£100,000+ |

**Note:** UK pricing is consistently higher due to planning requirements, labour costs, and groundwork complexity. These figures include structure, glass, mesh, turf, lighting, and basic groundworks. They exclude land, planning fees, changing rooms, and ancillary facilities.

**Construction timeline:** Typically 6–8 weeks from approved planning to playable court.

## Key Takeaways

- A standard padel court is exactly 20m x 10m with 4m-high enclosing walls
- Tempered glass (10–12mm) is mandatory for regulation courts and is the single most expensive material component
- Groundworks and drainage represent the largest portion of total cost (40–50%)
- Budget €25,000–€35,000 for a standard outdoor court in Europe, or £50,000–£80,000 in the UK
- Always verify local planning requirements before committing — they can add months and significant cost
