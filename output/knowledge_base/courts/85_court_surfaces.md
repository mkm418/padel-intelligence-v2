# Padel Court Surfaces Explained: Artificial Grass Types, Sand Fill Levels, and How Surface Affects Play

The playing surface is one of the most overlooked yet critical components of a padel court. It directly affects ball bounce, player movement, injury risk, and the overall speed of the game. All regulation padel courts use artificial grass with sand infill, but the specific turf type and infill quantity create very different playing experiences.

## The Three Main Artificial Grass Types

### 1. Monofilament (Straight Fibre)

- **Structure:** Individual extruded yarns, each a single strand (not split or slit), with filament thickness ranging from 160–250 microns
- **Durability:** High — maintains shape and performance over extended use
- **Game speed:** Medium to fast
- **Ball bounce:** Consistent and true, with a slightly faster ball release from the surface
- **Best for:** Club-level and commercial courts, regular competitive play
- **Cost:** Mid-range

Monofilament turf provides a reliable, professional-grade surface that balances performance with longevity. It is the most common choice for commercial padel installations worldwide.

### 2. Texturized (Curly) Monofilament

- **Structure:** Monofilament yarns that undergo a thermal-mechanical crimping process, creating a curly, textured appearance
- **Durability:** Very high — the curly fibres encapsulate sand infill, reducing fibre wear and sand displacement
- **Game speed:** Fast
- **Ball bounce:** Quick, lively bounce with excellent consistency
- **Best for:** Professional facilities, World Padel Tour (WPT) centre courts, high-traffic commercial venues
- **Cost:** Premium

Texturized monofilament is the preferred surface for professional padel. The WPT and most FIP-sanctioned events use this turf type. The curly fibres hold sand in place more effectively, reducing maintenance frequency and extending court life. This surface rewards attacking, fast-paced play.

### 3. Fibrillated (Split-Film)

- **Structure:** Flat tape yarns that are slit into a mesh-like network of interconnected fibres
- **Durability:** Medium — wears faster than monofilament under heavy use
- **Game speed:** Slower
- **Ball bounce:** Slightly lower and less predictable at high speeds
- **Best for:** Municipal facilities, schools, recreational parks, budget-conscious installations
- **Cost:** Most economical

Fibrillated turf is the most affordable option and holds sand well due to its mesh structure. However, it degrades faster under intensive play and delivers a noticeably slower game compared to monofilament alternatives.

## Sand Infill: Purpose, Types, and Levels

Sand infill is essential to padel court surfaces. It serves multiple functions:

- **Stabilises the turf fibres**, keeping them upright and preventing matting
- **Adds weight** to anchor the surface against movement
- **Controls ball bounce**, with infill level directly influencing how high and fast the ball rebounds
- **Provides cushioning** that reduces impact on players' joints

### Sand Specifications

- **Type:** Rounded silica sand (sub-angular to rounded grain shape to minimise fibre abrasion)
- **Grain size:** Typically 0.3–0.8mm diameter
- **Infill quantity:** Generally 14–18 kg per square metre for standard courts, though exact amounts vary by turf manufacturer and fibre height
- **Fibre height:** Most padel turf has a pile height of 10–15mm, with the sand filling approximately 60–75% of the fibre length

### Sand-Free Alternatives (Emerging)

A new generation of sand-free or "zero sand" artificial grass systems is entering the market (e.g., TigerTurf ZeroS). These use denser, textured fibres that provide stability and bounce without any infill. Benefits include reduced maintenance, no sand splash, and consistent performance. However, they remain a niche choice and are not yet widely adopted for professional play.

## How Surface Affects Play

### Ball Bounce
Higher sand levels slow the ball and reduce bounce height. Lower sand levels (or sand-free turf) produce a faster, higher-bouncing game. Professional-standard texturized turf with optimal sand fill produces the most consistent and lively bounce.

### Player Movement and Traction
Artificial grass with sand provides controlled sliding — players can execute the lateral slides that are fundamental to padel footwork. Overfilled surfaces become slippery, while underfilled surfaces feel sticky and increase injury risk. Proper infill level is critical for safe, fluid movement.

### Game Speed
Surface type creates distinct playing speeds:
- **Fast:** Texturized monofilament (professional standard)
- **Medium:** Straight monofilament (club standard)
- **Slow:** Fibrillated (recreational standard)

Faster surfaces reward aggressive, attacking play styles. Slower surfaces favour patient, defensive play and longer rallies.

### Injury Risk
Well-maintained surfaces with proper infill cushion player movements and reduce stress on knees, ankles, and hips. Worn or compacted surfaces increase the risk of slips, falls, and joint impact injuries.

## Maintenance Requirements

- **Brushing:** Regular brushing (at least weekly for high-use courts) redistributes sand and keeps fibres upright
- **Sand top-up:** Infill depletes over time through play and weather; annual top-ups are typical
- **Debris removal:** Leaves, litter, and organic matter must be cleared to prevent drainage issues and surface degradation
- **Deep cleaning:** Annual professional deep clean extends surface lifespan significantly

## Key Takeaways

- Texturized monofilament is the professional standard used on WPT and FIP events — it delivers the fastest, most consistent game
- Fibrillated turf is cheapest but wears faster and plays slower — suitable for recreational or budget contexts
- Sand infill level directly controls ball bounce height and game speed — getting it right is essential
- Maintenance (brushing, sand top-up) is not optional; neglected surfaces degrade quickly and become unsafe
- Sand-free turf systems are an emerging alternative but not yet mainstream for competitive play
