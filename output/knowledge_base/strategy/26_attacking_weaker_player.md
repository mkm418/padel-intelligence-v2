# How to Attack a Weaker Opponent in Padel Doubles

In padel doubles, targeting the weaker player is a fundamental tactic — but doing it predictably turns an advantage into a liability. The key is applying pressure systematically while maintaining enough variation to keep both opponents uncertain.

## Identifying the Weaker Player

Before executing any targeting strategy, you need to accurately assess which player is weaker and in what areas:

- **Watch the warm-up.** Technical limitations (poor volleys, uncomfortable overheads, stiff backhand) reveal themselves quickly.
- **Test both sides early.** In the first 2–3 games, distribute shots evenly and observe which player makes more errors, retreats under pressure, or avoids certain shots.
- **Read body language.** The weaker player often positions further from the net, hesitates before committing to shots, and looks to their partner for guidance.
- **Assess specific weaknesses.** A player might be strong from the back but fragile at the net, or competent on volleys but helpless against lobs. Target the specific weakness, not just the player.

## The "Fridge" Technique

"Putting the stronger player in the fridge" means freezing them out of the rally by directing the vast majority of shots to the weaker player. This creates compounding pressure:

- **Direct pressure:** The weaker player faces more shots, more decisions, and more opportunities to make errors.
- **Indirect pressure:** The stronger player loses rhythm, becomes frustrated at their inability to help, and may overcompensate when they do get the ball (leading to forced errors).
- **Psychological pressure:** The weaker player feels the burden of knowing they are being targeted, which accelerates mental fatigue.

### How to Execute Without Becoming Predictable

The trap most pairs fall into is robotically hitting every ball to the same player. Opponents adjust — the stronger player starts covering more court, the weaker player expects the ball and grooves their responses. To avoid this:

1. **Use a 70/30 distribution.** Send approximately 70% of shots to the weaker player and 30% to the stronger player. The 30% keeps the stronger player honest and prevents them from poaching into the weaker player's zone.

2. **Vary the shot type, not just the target.** Hit the weaker player with different speeds, spins, heights, and depths:
   - Low, fast shots at their feet when they are at the net
   - High lobs to their backhand overhead
   - Soft, angled drops that force them to move forward
   - Flat drives aimed at their body to jam their swing

3. **Attack different zones on their side.** Do not just hit to the same spot. Alternate between:
   - Wide to the side glass
   - Down the center (between the two players)
   - Short angles toward the net
   - Deep to the back glass

4. **Occasional misdirection.** Hit a sudden, aggressive shot to the stronger player when they are not expecting it. This prevents them from permanently shading toward the weaker player's side.

## Exploiting the Backhand

Most padel players have a weaker backhand than forehand, especially at amateur and intermediate levels. Targeting the weaker player's backhand creates compounding difficulty:

- **High backhands** are particularly effective because they limit attacking options. The player is forced to hit defensive, upward returns.
- **Low backhands at the net** force uncomfortable volleys that often pop up for easy put-aways.
- **Backhand overheads** are rare weapons in amateur padel — lobbing to the weaker player's backhand overhead is almost always effective.

## Body Shots: The Underused Weapon

Hitting directly at the weaker player's body (chest or hip level) when they are at the net is extremely effective:

- **Why it works:** The player cannot extend their racket fully, leading to cramped, weak returns.
- **When to use it:** During transition moments when the player is moving forward, or when they are standing square to the net instead of sideways.
- **Frequency:** Use sparingly (once every 4–5 shots to that player) to maintain surprise value.

## Tiring the Weaker Player

Physical fatigue amplifies technical weakness. Force the weaker player to move more:

- **Hit to open spaces on their side** to make them run.
- **Alternate between deep and short shots** to force forward-backward movement.
- **Use angles** that pull them wide, then follow up with shots to the opposite side.
- **Target them in long rallies** — the weaker player's technique breaks down faster under fatigue.

## When the Strategy Backfires

Watch for signs that targeting the weaker player is not working:

- The weaker player is actually grooved in and hitting better from the repetition
- The stronger player has shifted court coverage and is intercepting your shots
- Your pair is becoming one-dimensional and missing shots from forcing the pattern
- The opponents have adjusted their formation (e.g., the stronger player is now covering center)

**Adjustment:** Temporarily shift focus to the stronger player for 3–4 points to reset the dynamic, then return to the targeting strategy.

## Key Takeaways

- Identify specific weaknesses (backhand, overhead, net play) rather than just the "weaker player"
- Use a 70/30 distribution to target without becoming predictable
- Vary shot type, speed, and placement within the weaker player's zone
- Body shots and high backhands are the highest-value targets
- Monitor whether the strategy is working and adjust if opponents adapt
