# The Role of Communication Between Padel Partners

Communication is the invisible skill that separates cohesive padel pairs from two individuals sharing a court. In a sport where partners must move as a connected unit, make split-second decisions about who takes the ball, and coordinate tactical shifts mid-rally, the quality of communication directly determines the quality of play.

## The Three Communication Windows

### 1. Before the Point (Strategic Planning)

The moments before each serve or return are the most important communication window:

- **Discuss the plan.** "I'll serve wide, you poach if they go cross-court." Clear pre-point agreements eliminate hesitation during the rally.
- **Share observations.** "She keeps lobbing to my side" or "He's standing too close to the net." These observations help both players adjust positioning.
- **Confirm roles.** Especially after formation changes or side switches, verbally confirm who is covering what zone.

**On serve:** The server's partner uses hand signals behind their back to indicate their intention:
- **Closed fist:** "I'm staying on my side"
- **Open hand:** "I'm going to poach (move across)"
- **Finger pointing left/right:** Suggested serve direction
- **Wiggle/wave:** "I'm going to fake a poach"

The server acknowledges the signal with a verbal "yes" or by repeating the signal.

### 2. During the Point (Real-Time Calls)

In-rally communication must be instant, clear, and loud enough for your partner to hear:

**Essential calls:**
- **"Mine!"** — "I'm taking this ball." Use for any ball in the center or any ball where there could be confusion.
- **"Yours!"** — "You take this ball." Use when you cannot reach it or when it is clearly on your partner's side.
- **"Leave!"** — "The ball is going out. Do not hit it." Critical for balls heading toward the glass that may go out.
- **"Switch!"** — "We need to swap sides." Used when one player has been pulled to the other's side and a crossover is needed.
- **"Lob!"** — "I'm hitting a lob — move forward." Alerts your partner to advance to the net as the lob travels.
- **"Back!"** — "They lobbed us — retreat together." Ensures both players move back simultaneously.
- **"Net!"** — "Move forward to the net." Used when a quality shot creates a transition opportunity.

**Timing rule:** Call as early as possible. A "mine" called after your partner has already committed to the ball is useless — and potentially dangerous.

### 3. Between Points (Tactical Adjustments)

The 20–25 seconds between points should include:

- **Quick tactical review.** "They're targeting your backhand — let's position wider" or "Good lob — keep doing that."
- **Encouragement.** A simple "good ball" or "no worries" after an error keeps morale high.
- **Game plan check.** "Are we still serving wide?" or "Should we start lobbing more?"
- **Score awareness.** Confirm the score together to avoid confusion, especially in golden point or tiebreak situations.

## Non-Verbal Communication

### Body Language

- **Eye contact** between points to confirm plans and show engagement.
- **Hand gestures** — a raised hand to indicate "stay back" or a forward motion to indicate "let's advance."
- **Positioning** — your position on the court communicates your intentions to your partner. Shifting closer to the center signals you are ready to poach; stepping back signals caution.

### Energy and Demeanor

Your body language during the match sends constant messages to your partner:

- **Positive signals:** Upright posture, quick movements, engaged facial expression, fist pumps after good points.
- **Negative signals:** Dropped shoulders, slow movements, head shaking, visible frustration after errors.

Even if you feel frustrated, maintaining positive body language supports your partner's confidence and focus.

## Communication Rules for Padel Partners

### Rule 1: Over-Communicate

It is always better to say "mine" when it is obviously your ball than to stay silent and risk confusion on the next ambiguous ball. Build the habit of calling everything, and your partner will trust your calls when they matter.

### Rule 2: Never Blame

After a lost point, the only productive communication is forward-looking:

- **Not:** "Why did you hit that?" or "That was your ball."
- **Instead:** "Let's play it deeper next time" or "I should have called that sooner."

Blame destroys confidence and creates tension that compounds errors. Even if your partner made a clear mistake, the most effective response is encouragement.

### Rule 3: Be Specific

Vague tactical discussions waste time:

- **Not:** "Let's play better."
- **Instead:** "Let's target his backhand when he's at the net."

Specific plans create aligned execution. General encouragement creates individual interpretation.

### Rule 4: Establish Rules Before the Match

Before the first point, agree on:

- **Who takes the middle ball.** Convention is the player whose forehand faces the center, but some pairs prefer the stronger volleyer.
- **Who calls "leave."** The player closer to the side glass or back glass is better positioned to judge whether a ball is going out.
- **Serve signals.** Confirm the hand signal system you will use during service games.
- **Switching protocol.** When one player is pulled wide, when should you switch and when should you recover to your own side?

### Rule 5: Adapt to Your Partner

- **Quiet partners** need more explicit verbal cues from you. Increase your calling volume and frequency.
- **Vocal partners** may talk too much during rallies. A simple "let's keep calls short" can streamline mid-point communication.
- **New partners** need extra communication because you do not yet have established patterns. Over-communicate in the first few games.
- **Experienced partners** can operate with less verbal communication because they anticipate each other's movements. But never let comfortable silence become lazy silence.

## Communication in Pressure Moments

When the match is tight (5-5 or tiebreak), communication becomes both more important and more difficult:

- **Keep it simple.** Long tactical discussions before critical points create overthinking. One clear plan: "Serve wide, I'll poach."
- **Stay positive.** "We've got this" or "One point at a time" is more effective than detailed tactical analysis.
- **Maintain physical communication.** A fist bump, a tap on the shoulder, or a brief high-five between points maintains connection and reduces isolation.

## Key Takeaways

- Use the three communication windows: before the point (planning), during the point (calls), between points (adjustments)
- Essential calls include "mine," "yours," "leave," "switch," "lob," and "back"
- Over-communicate rather than under-communicate — build trust through consistent calling
- Never blame your partner; only offer forward-looking, specific feedback
- Establish middle-ball rules, serve signals, and switching protocols before the match
- Maintain positive body language even during difficult stretches
