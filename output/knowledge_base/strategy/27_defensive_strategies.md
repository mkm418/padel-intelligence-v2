# Padel Defensive Strategies When Stuck at the Back

Being pinned at the back of the court in padel is not a death sentence — it is a tactical phase that requires patience, smart shot selection, and coordinated movement. The best defensive players turn the back court into a platform for counter-attacks rather than simply surviving.

## Why You End Up at the Back

Understanding why you are defending helps you choose the right response:

- **After a return of serve:** The returning pair typically starts behind the service line while the serving pair controls the net.
- **After being lobbed successfully:** If opponents push you back with a deep lob, you are forced into a defensive position.
- **After a failed transition:** If your approach shot was too short or weak, opponents' aggressive volleys or smashes push you back.
- **Against dominant net teams:** Some pairs are so effective at the net that they consistently force opponents into defensive positions.

## Foundational Defensive Principles

### Stay Connected as a Pair

The most critical defensive rule: both players must remain at the same depth. If one player is at the back glass and the other is at the service line, the gap between them becomes an easy target. Move backward and forward together, maintaining 3–4 meters of lateral distance.

### Position Relative to the Glass

- Stand approximately 70 cm from the back glass — close enough to play rebounds but far enough to have swing room.
- Keep your weight slightly forward on the balls of your feet, not leaning back into the glass.
- Angle your body sideways (not square to the net) so you can rotate into shots after wall rebounds.

### Patience Over Heroics

Defensive padel is about waiting for the right moment to transition, not forcing spectacular shots from bad positions. Accept that you may need to defend for 5–10 shots before a transition opportunity arises. Rushing leads to unforced errors.

## The 5 Defensive Shot Options

### 1. The Deep Lob

The primary escape tool from the back court.

- **Target:** Deep to the opponents' back glass, ideally on their weaker overhead side.
- **Height:** High enough that opponents cannot intercept with an aggressive smash (minimum 4–5 meters above the net).
- **Purpose:** Forces opponents away from the net, creating time and space for you to advance.
- **Risk:** A short lob is the most punishable shot in padel — if it does not reach the back glass, it becomes an easy overhead for the opponent.

### 2. The Chiquita (Low Dipping Shot)

A soft, low shot aimed at the feet of the net players.

- **Target:** The center of the court between both net players, or directly at the weaker volleyer's feet.
- **Execution:** Use gentle topspin or a flat touch to make the ball dip below net height before reaching the opponents.
- **Purpose:** Forces opponents to volley upward, giving you a higher ball on the next shot and an opportunity to advance.
- **When to use:** When opponents are standing too close to the net or when you have time to set up the shot.

### 3. The Wall Counter-Attack

Turn the opponents' smash into your opportunity.

- **Execution:** Allow the smash to hit the back glass, read the rebound trajectory, and drive the ball low and fast back into the court.
- **Target:** Aim at the feet of the net players or into the gap between them.
- **Purpose:** The speed of the counter-attack gives opponents less time to react than a defensive lob.
- **Skill requirement:** This demands excellent glass-reading ability and timing. Practice reading rebounds from different angles and speeds.

### 4. The Side Wall Escape

When the ball comes off the side glass, use the angle to create unexpected returns.

- **Execution:** Let the ball rebound off the side glass, step into it, and redirect cross-court.
- **Target:** Aim for the opposite side of the court to pull opponents out of position.
- **Purpose:** Changes the angle of the rally and can create openings in the center.

### 5. The Slow, Deep Return

When no transition opportunity exists, simply keep the ball deep and low.

- **Execution:** Hit a controlled, low-paced shot deep into the opponents' court, targeting the back third.
- **Purpose:** Denies opponents an easy volley, buys time, and prevents you from making an unforced error.
- **When to use:** When you are out of position, off-balance, or when your partner is not ready to advance.

## Glass Defense: Reading the Rebound

Mastering back-glass and double-wall rebounds is essential for back-court defense:

- **Back glass only:** The ball rebounds roughly at the same angle it arrived. Step back, let it bounce, then play.
- **Side glass then back glass (double wall):** The ball changes direction dramatically. Position yourself to face the corner and let the ball come to you rather than chasing it.
- **Back glass then side glass:** The ball kicks sideways after the back wall. Anticipate the lateral movement and adjust your feet early.

**Key principle:** Always let the ball complete its full rebound path before swinging. Hitting too early (before the ball finishes bouncing off the glass) leads to mishits and weak returns.

## When to Stay vs. When to Push Forward

- **Stay back when:** Your shot was short, weak, or landed in the middle of the court with pace. Advancing after a poor shot invites a passing shot.
- **Push forward when:** Your lob is deep, your chiquita is low, or your counter-attack is well-placed. Move together immediately.
- **Regroup when:** One player is out of position or one player played a quality shot but the other is not ready to advance.

## Key Takeaways

- Stay connected with your partner at the same depth — never leave a gap between front and back
- Use lobs, chiquitas, wall counter-attacks, side wall escapes, and deep returns as your five defensive tools
- Master glass rebounds — let the ball complete its full path before hitting
- Be patient: wait for a genuine transition opportunity rather than forcing risky shots
- Move forward together the instant you execute a quality defensive shot
