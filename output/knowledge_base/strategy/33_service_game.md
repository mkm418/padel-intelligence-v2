# Service Game Strategy in Padel

The service game in padel is fundamentally different from tennis. The underarm serve limits raw power, making the serve a tactical setup tool rather than an outright weapon. Holding serve requires a coordinated approach between server and partner, while breaking serve demands aggressive returns and smart positioning.

## The Purpose of the Padel Serve

The serve in padel exists to:

1. **Start the point on your terms.** A well-placed serve creates a weak return that your pair can capitalize on.
2. **Enable net advancement.** The server must reach the net quickly after serving — the serve is the vehicle that gets you there.
3. **Set up the first volley.** The quality of the serve directly determines the difficulty of the first volley. A great serve produces an easy first volley; a weak serve produces a punishing return.

## Serving Patterns for Holding Serve

### Placement Over Power

Power serves are largely ineffective in padel because the underarm technique limits pace, and the glass walls keep returns in play. Instead, focus on:

- **Wide to the side glass:** Forces the returner to move laterally, creating an open court for the first volley. The ball bouncing off the side glass creates an awkward angle.
- **Down the T (center):** Reduces the returner's angle for cross-court returns and feeds the ball into the server's partner's volley zone.
- **Body serve:** Jams the returner, limiting their swing and producing a weak, central return that the net player can poach.

### Serve Speed Variation

- **Faster serves** (first serve) reduce the returner's reaction time and allow less precise returns.
- **Slower, spinning serves** (second serve or variation) change the returner's timing and can produce pop-up returns when the spin catches them off guard.
- **Mix speeds unpredictably.** If the returner expects pace, throw in a slow, spinning serve. If they are waiting for spin, hit through it with more speed.

### Serve Direction Patterns

Do not fall into predictable serving patterns. Mix directions across the service game:

- **Game plan example:** Wide → T → Body → Wide (never the same direction twice in a row)
- **Adjust based on returner behavior:** If they stand wide anticipating a wide serve, go down the T. If they crowd the T, serve wide.

## The Server's Partner: The Hidden Weapon

The server's partner at the net is often the most important player in the service game:

- **Poaching:** The net player moves across the center to intercept the return with an aggressive volley. Effective poaching puts enormous pressure on the returner and can win free points.
- **Faking:** The net player makes a poaching movement without committing, causing the returner to change direction mid-swing. Fakes are almost as effective as actual poaches.
- **Signaling:** Professional pairs use hand signals behind the back to communicate:
  - **Closed fist:** "I'm staying" (covering my side)
  - **Open hand:** "I'm poaching" (moving to intercept)
  - **Finger point:** Direction the server should serve
  - **Wiggle:** "I'm faking" (pretending to poach)

## Service Formations

### Conventional Formation

- Server serves diagonally, then moves to the net on their side.
- Partner stands at the net on the opposite side.
- **Advantage:** Natural court coverage, simple positioning.
- **Disadvantage:** Predictable coverage that experienced returners can exploit.

### Australian Formation

- Both the server and partner start on the same side of the court.
- After serving, the server crosses to cover the open side.
- **Advantage:** Disrupts the returner's patterns, covers the cross-court return naturally, creates confusion.
- **Disadvantage:** Requires faster server movement to cover the open court. Used more frequently at advanced levels.
- **When to use:** When the returner consistently hits effective cross-court returns, or to introduce unpredictability mid-match.

## Holding Serve: The Complete Sequence

1. **Pre-point:** Signal your partner (poach, stay, or fake). Choose serve direction.
2. **Serve:** Execute with placement focus. Hit to the planned target.
3. **Advance:** Move forward immediately after serving. Take 3–4 quick steps toward the net.
4. **Split step:** Execute a split step as the returner makes contact. This readies you for the return's direction.
5. **First volley:** The most important shot in the service game. Aim deep, low, and preferably at the opponents' feet. A weak first volley surrenders the point.
6. **Consolidate:** After a successful first volley, maintain net position with your partner and build the point from there.

## Breaking Serve: Tactics for the Returning Pair

### Return Quality

- **Deep, low returns** to the server's feet as they advance are the most effective. The server is moving forward, making low balls extremely difficult to volley.
- **Lob returns** over the net player push the serving pair back and neutralize their net advantage.
- **Returns to the center** create confusion between the server and the net player about who takes the ball.

### Targeting the Server in Transition

The server is most vulnerable during the 2–3 steps between serving and reaching the net. A fast, low return aimed at their feet during this transition forces a difficult half-volley from an uncomfortable position.

### Break Point Mentality

- **Be aggressive on second serves.** Step into the court and attack the return. Second serves in padel are often slow and predictable — punish them.
- **Target the net player.** On break points, the net player feels pressure too. A return aimed at their body or feet can produce an error.
- **Use surprise tactics.** A lob return on break point, when the serving pair expects an aggressive drive, can catch them off guard.

## Key Takeaways

- The serve is a tactical setup tool — prioritize placement and variation over power
- The server's partner at the net is the hidden weapon: use poaching, faking, and signaling
- The first volley after the serve is the most critical shot in the service game
- On return, target the server's feet during their net approach transition
- Mix formations (conventional and Australian) to keep the returning pair uncertain
- On break points, increase aggression on second serves and use tactical surprises
