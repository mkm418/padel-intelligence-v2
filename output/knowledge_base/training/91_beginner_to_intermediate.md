# How to Go from Beginner to Intermediate in Padel: The 10 Skills You Need to Develop in Order

The journey from beginner to intermediate in padel follows a predictable path. Players who develop these 10 skills in sequence progress faster than those who skip fundamentals to chase advanced techniques. Each skill builds on the previous one, creating a solid foundation for long-term improvement.

## Skill 1: The Continental Grip and Ready Position

**Why it's first**: Everything in padel starts from how you hold the racket and how you stand between shots.

- Use a continental grip (like holding a hammer) for nearly every shot in padel
- Unlike tennis, you do not switch grips between forehand and backhand
- Ready position: racket up at chest height, knees slightly bent, weight on the balls of your feet
- Practice the split step — a small hop that times your landing with the opponent's contact

**Milestone**: You can rally 10 shots without thinking about your grip.

## Skill 2: Basic Volleys (Forehand and Backhand)

**Why it's second**: Padel is a net game. The team that controls the net wins approximately 70% of points.

- Keep the swing short — a punching motion, not a full swing
- Contact the ball in front of your body
- Aim for depth rather than power
- Forehand volleys use a slightly open racket face; backhand volleys use a firm wrist

**Milestone**: You can sustain a volley rally of 15+ shots with a partner.

## Skill 3: The Lob

**Why it's third**: The lob is the most important defensive and tactical shot in padel. It gets you out of trouble and pushes opponents away from the net.

- Use a low-to-high swing path with an open racket face
- Aim for height (4-5 meters above net) and depth (landing near the back glass)
- A good lob buys you time to recover court position
- Practice both forehand and backhand lobs

**Milestone**: 7 out of 10 lobs land in the back third of the court without getting smashed.

## Skill 4: The Serve

**Why it's fourth**: The underhand serve in padel is about placement and consistency, not power.

- Must be hit underhand, with contact at or below waist level
- Bounce the ball and strike it cleanly with a slice motion
- Target zones: the body (jam the returner), the side glass (awkward rebound), or deep center
- The goal is to start the point and get to the net — not to win the point outright

**Milestone**: You can place 8 out of 10 serves in the correct service box with intention.

## Skill 5: The Return of Serve

**Why it's fifth**: A weak return gives the serving team immediate net control.

- Default return for beginners: a deep lob that pushes the serving team back
- As you develop: add a driven return (low and fast) or a chiquita (soft dip to the feet)
- Position yourself slightly inside the baseline and read the server's toss
- Aim for consistency over aggression — getting the return back is the priority

**Milestone**: You can successfully return 8 out of 10 serves into play.

## Skill 6: Playing Off the Back Glass (Salida de Pared)

**Why it's sixth**: Glass play is what makes padel unique. Beginners instinctively hit every ball before it reaches the wall — intermediates let it bounce.

- Let balls that are heading deep bounce off the back glass instead of chasing them
- Position yourself sideways to the wall, 1-1.5 meters away
- Wait for the ball to come to you after the rebound
- Start with gentle feeds and gradually increase pace

**Milestone**: You can play 5 consecutive back-glass rebounds cleanly into the court.

## Skill 7: Court Positioning and Pair Movement

**Why it's seventh**: Individual technique means nothing if you and your partner leave gaps all over the court.

- Move as a unit — imagine a 3-4 meter rope connecting you to your partner
- Both up (at the net) or both back (at the baseline) — never one up and one back for extended periods
- The "T" position at the net (both players near the center) is the strongest offensive formation
- Avoid "no man's land" (3-4 meters behind the net) — it's the worst place to be on the court

**Milestone**: You and your partner naturally move forward and backward together without verbal prompting.

## Skill 8: The Bandeja

**Why it's eighth**: The bandeja is the most common overhead in padel — a controlled, sliced overhead that keeps you at the net.

- Hit with a side-on stance, not facing the net
- Contact the ball at head height or slightly above with a slicing motion
- The goal is placement and control, not power
- Aim cross-court and deep to keep opponents pinned at the back
- Always recover to the net position after hitting

**Milestone**: You can hit 7 out of 10 bandejas that land in the court and allow you to maintain net position.

## Skill 9: Basic Point Construction

**Why it's ninth**: At intermediate level, you stop hitting random shots and start building points with intention.

- **Pattern 1**: Lob → push opponents back → approach the net → volley to finish
- **Pattern 2**: Drive deep → force a weak return → attack with a volley
- **Pattern 3**: Defend with lobs → wait for a short ball → chiquita → take the net
- Understand that most padel points require 8-15 shots — patience is essential
- Prioritize consistency: the team that makes fewer unforced errors usually wins

**Milestone**: You can describe your point strategy before a game and execute it at least occasionally.

## Skill 10: Communication with Your Partner

**Why it's tenth**: This skill transforms two individual players into a functioning team.

- **Essential calls**: "Mine," "Yours," "Switch," "Leave" (for out balls), "Lob," "Stay"
- Discuss basic strategy before the match: who takes middle balls, how to handle lobs
- Encourage your partner after errors — negativity destroys padel partnerships faster than any technical weakness
- Debrief after games: what worked, what to adjust

**Milestone**: You communicate naturally during points without it disrupting your play.

## The Beginner-to-Intermediate Timeline

With regular play (2-3 times per week) and occasional coaching:

| Phase | Duration | Focus |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Complete Beginner | Weeks 1-4 | Skills 1-3 (grip, volleys, lob) |
| Advanced Beginner | Weeks 5-10 | Skills 4-6 (serve, return, glass play) |
| Early Intermediate | Weeks 11-20 | Skills 7-8 (positioning, bandeja) |
| Solid Intermediate | Weeks 21-30 | Skills 9-10 (point construction, communication) |

This timeline assumes consistent practice and ideally some structured coaching. Playing without feedback extends each phase significantly.

## Key Takeaways

- Develop skills in order — skipping fundamentals creates gaps that are harder to fix later
- The continental grip and ready position are the foundation for everything
- Padel is a net game: volleys, lobs, and the bandeja are more important than big groundstrokes
- Glass play (skill 6) is the skill that most clearly separates beginners from intermediates
- Court positioning with your partner (skill 7) matters more than individual shot quality
- Patience and consistency beat power at every level of padel
