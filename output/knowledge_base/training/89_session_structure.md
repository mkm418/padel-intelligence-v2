# How to Structure a Padel Training Session

A well-structured padel training session maximizes improvement while minimizing injury risk. Whether you're a beginner or an advanced player, every session should follow a deliberate progression from warm-up through technical work, tactical application, competitive play, and cool-down. The exact emphasis shifts with player level, but the framework remains consistent.

## Phase 1: Warm-Up (10-15 Minutes)

The warm-up is non-negotiable. Skipping it significantly increases the risk of muscle strains, shoulder injuries, and ankle sprains — all common in padel.

### General Activation (3-5 minutes)
- Light jogging around or outside the court
- Skipping rope, high knees, butt kicks, or side shuffles
- Goal: raise heart rate and increase blood flow to muscles

### Dynamic Stretching (3-5 minutes)
Use movement-based stretches rather than static holds:
- **Arm circles and shoulder rolls** — critical for overhead shots (bandeja, vibora, smash)
- **Torso rotations** — prepare the core for rotational strokes
- **Leg swings** (forward/backward and lateral) — open up hips for split steps and lunges
- **Walking lunges with rotation** — combine lower body and core activation
- **Ankle circles and calf raises** — protect the most injury-prone joint in padel

### Padel-Specific Warm-Up (3-5 minutes)
- Shadow swings: forehand, backhand, volleys, overhead motions
- Light rallies with a partner at 50-60% effort, focusing on feel and timing
- Mini-games: short-court volleys or cooperative rallies to 10 shots
- Gentle serve and return practice

## Phase 2: Technical Drills (15-25 Minutes)

This phase focuses on isolated skill development. Structure drills around the four pillars of padel training: physical, technical, tactical, and psychological.

### Beginner Focus
- **Groundstrokes**: forehand and backhand drives with correct grip and compact swing
- **Basic volleys**: forehand and backhand with continental grip, short punching motion
- **Lob practice**: cooperative lob rallies to develop height and depth control
- **Glass play introduction**: simple back-wall rebounds, letting the ball come to you

### Intermediate Focus
- **Bandeja technique**: overhead slice with correct footwork (side-on positioning)
- **Wall exits (salida de pared)**: timing and positioning for back-glass rebounds
- **Serve placement**: targeting zones with consistent underhand technique
- **Chiquita practice**: soft, dipping shots aimed at opponents' feet

### Advanced Focus
- **Vibora and bandeja transitions**: disguising shot selection from the same preparation
- **Bajada de pared**: attacking off the back glass with topspin or flat drives
- **Serve-and-volley patterns**: first serve plus net approach sequences
- **Pressure volleys**: rapid-fire exchanges at close range

## Phase 3: Tactical and Situational Play (15-20 Minutes)

Move from isolated drills to game-realistic scenarios. This phase bridges technique and match play.

- **Point construction patterns**: practice specific sequences (e.g., deep return → lob → net approach → volley winner)
- **Situational starts**: begin points from specific positions (both back, one up one back, both at net)
- **Transition drills**: practice moving from defense to offense and back
- **Communication exercises**: practice calling shots with your partner ("mine," "yours," "switch," "leave")
- **Ladder rallies**: set progressive targets (keep 5, then 10, then 15 consecutive shots in play)

## Phase 4: Competitive Point Play (15-25 Minutes)

Apply everything under match pressure. Structure this phase to simulate real competition:

- **Regular sets or tiebreakers** with full scoring
- **Conditioned games**: play with specific rules (e.g., all points must start with a lob, or no smashes allowed)
- **Yellow/red card format**: penalize repeated errors to build consistency under pressure
- **First-to-X formats**: short, high-intensity games (first to 5 points, then rotate partners)

### Level-Specific Adjustments
- **Beginners**: play cooperative points first (rally to 10 before competing), focus on keeping the ball in play
- **Intermediate**: introduce tactical constraints (must win the net before finishing the point)
- **Advanced**: full-intensity match play with post-point analysis between games

## Phase 5: Cool-Down (5-10 Minutes)

Neglecting the cool-down leads to increased soreness and slower recovery.

- **Light rallying or walking** (2-3 minutes): gradually reduce heart rate
- **Static stretching** (5-7 minutes): hold each stretch for 20-30 seconds
  - Shoulder and tricep stretches (for overhead work)
  - Wrist and forearm stretches (racket grip fatigue)
  - Quad, hamstring, and calf stretches
  - Hip flexor and groin stretches (lateral movement recovery)
- **Breathing exercises**: 1-2 minutes of deep breathing to activate recovery

## Adapting Session Length by Level

| Level | Total Time | Warm-Up | Technical | Tactical | Match Play | Cool-Down |
|-------|-----------|---------|-----------|----------|------------|-----------|
| Beginner | 60 min | 10 min | 25 min | 10 min | 10 min | 5 min |
| Intermediate | 75 min | 10 min | 20 min | 15 min | 20 min | 10 min |
| Advanced | 90 min | 15 min | 15 min | 20 min | 30 min | 10 min |

Beginners spend more time on technique; advanced players emphasize competitive play and tactical complexity.

## Key Takeaways

- Every session should follow 5 phases: warm-up, technical drills, tactical play, competitive points, cool-down
- Warm-up is mandatory — dynamic stretching plus padel-specific movement prevents injuries
- The balance between technical and tactical work shifts as players advance
- Cool-down with static stretching accelerates recovery and reduces injury risk
- Structure each phase with clear objectives rather than "just hitting around"
- Use conditioned games and progressive challenges to make point play purposeful
