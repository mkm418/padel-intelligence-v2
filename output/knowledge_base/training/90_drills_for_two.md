# Padel Drills for Two Players: 20 Effective Drills to Improve Specific Shots and Patterns

Training with a partner is the most effective way to improve in padel. These 20 drills are organized by skill focus and can be adapted to any level. Each drill includes the setup, execution, and what to focus on.

## Volley Drills

### 1. Rapid-Fire Volley Exchange
**Setup**: Both players at the net, 2-3 meters apart.
**Execution**: Rally volleys back and forth as fast as possible, aiming for control, not power.
**Focus**: Short, compact swing. Keep the racket head up. Quick recovery to ready position between shots.

### 2. Forehand-Only / Backhand-Only Volleys
**Setup**: Both at net, rally only to one side.
**Execution**: Play 20 volleys exclusively to forehand, then switch to backhand.
**Focus**: Isolates the weaker side. Develop consistency on both wings before mixing.

### 3. Deep Volley Pressure
**Setup**: One player at net, partner at baseline.
**Execution**: Net player hits deep volleys toward the back glass. Baseline player returns. Net player must keep every volley deep (past the service line).
**Focus**: Depth on volleys to prevent the opponent from lobbing. Teaches the value of a heavy, deep volley.

### 4. Defensive Resist Drill
**Setup**: One player attacks aggressively at net, the other defends.
**Execution**: Attacker hits 5 consecutive hard volleys. Defender must return all 5 with low, controlled shots. Switch roles.
**Focus**: Defensive resilience. Keep the ball low under pressure. Absorb pace rather than adding to it.

## Lob and Overhead Drills

### 5. Lob-Bandeja Rotation
**Setup**: One player at baseline, one at net.
**Execution**: Baseline player lobs. Net player hits a bandeja, recovers to net position. Repeat 10 times, then switch.
**Focus**: Bandeja technique (side-on footwork, slice contact, controlled placement). Recovery steps after the overhead.

### 6. Lob Height and Depth Challenge
**Setup**: Both players at baseline on the same side.
**Execution**: Rally using only lobs. The lob must clear an imaginary line at net height and land in the back third of the court. Score a point for each successful lob.
**Focus**: Lob accuracy — height to clear opponents, depth to push them back. Essential defensive skill.

### 7. Smash Decision Drill
**Setup**: One player feeds lobs of varying height and depth. Partner at net.
**Execution**: Net player must decide: short lob = smash to finish; deep lob = bandeja to stay in position. Call out the decision before hitting.
**Focus**: Decision-making under pressure. Choosing the right overhead for each situation rather than smashing everything.

## Wall Play Drills

### 8. Back Glass Exit (Salida de Pared)
**Setup**: One player at net feeds deep drives that hit the back glass. Partner positioned near the back wall.
**Execution**: Back player lets the ball bounce off the glass, then plays a controlled return (lob or drive).
**Focus**: Patience — wait for the ball to come to you. Footwork to position sideways. Reading the rebound angle.

### 9. Side Wall Recovery
**Setup**: One player feeds balls that hit the side glass at various angles.
**Execution**: Partner reads the rebound and returns the ball into play. Start slow and increase pace.
**Focus**: Anticipating glass angles. Staying low and balanced. Short backswing for cramped positions.

### 10. Corner Chaos Drill
**Setup**: One player hits fast-paced shots into the back corner (where side and back glass meet).
**Execution**: Partner must read the double rebound and return a controlled shot. Rotate after 10 balls.
**Focus**: The hardest glass play in padel. Reading complex rebound angles. Survival mindset — just get it back.

### 11. Bajada de Pared Attack
**Setup**: One player lobs deep. Partner near the back wall.
**Execution**: Back player lets the lob bounce off the glass, then attacks with a flat or topspin drive aimed at the opponents' feet.
**Focus**: Turning defense into offense. Timing the glass rebound. Hitting down through the ball.

## Chiquita and Transition Drills

### 12. Chiquita to Net Approach
**Setup**: One player at baseline, one at net.
**Execution**: Baseline player hits a soft, dipping chiquita toward the net player's feet, then immediately moves forward to take the net. Net player blocks the ball back. Play out the point.
**Focus**: The chiquita is the key transition shot in padel. Practice soft touch, low trajectory, and immediate forward movement.

### 13. Transition Zone Footwork
**Setup**: Both players rally from mid-court (no-man's land).
**Execution**: Play points where both players start in the transition zone. The goal is to win the net through a chiquita or quality approach shot.
**Focus**: Escaping the danger zone. Quick decision-making: approach with chiquita or retreat with lob.

## Serve and Return Drills

### 14. Serve Placement Targets
**Setup**: Place targets (cones, towels) in different zones of the service box.
**Execution**: Serve 10 balls to each target. Track accuracy percentage.
**Focus**: Consistency and placement. The serve in padel is about starting the point well, not winning it outright. Aim for the body, the side glass, or deep in the box.

### 15. Serve Plus First Volley
**Setup**: One player serves, the other returns.
**Execution**: Server must serve and immediately move forward for the first volley. Play out the point from there.
**Focus**: The most important two-shot sequence in padel. Serve quality plus net transition timing.

### 16. Return of Serve Practice
**Setup**: One player serves, the other focuses exclusively on the return.
**Execution**: Returner practices 10 returns with a lob, 10 with a drive, and 10 with a chiquita. Track which return type generates the best result.
**Focus**: Return versatility. Many players default to one return type — this forces variety.

## Pattern and Point Construction Drills

### 17. Cross-Court Rally Challenge
**Setup**: Both players on diagonally opposite sides of the court.
**Execution**: Rally only cross-court for 3 minutes. Count consecutive shots. Try to beat your record.
**Focus**: Consistency and placement on cross-court shots, the safest and most common rally pattern in padel.

### 18. Pressure Point Rally
**Setup**: Start each point with a specific shot (lob, serve return, or drive).
**Execution**: Play first to 5 points. Loser does 10 push-ups (or any forfeit).
**Focus**: Match simulation with consequences. Builds mental toughness and shot selection under pressure.

### 19. Net Control Game
**Setup**: Both players start at the baseline.
**Execution**: Play points where the goal is to win the net and hold it for at least 3 consecutive shots before finishing. Points only count if the net was won first.
**Focus**: Point construction. Teaches that padel is about building toward the net, not hitting winners from the back.

### 20. Two-on-One Scramble
**Setup**: One player on one side, partner on the other side covering the full court alone.
**Execution**: The pair plays normally. The solo player must survive using placement, lobs, and smart court coverage. Play to 7 points, then rotate.
**Focus**: For the solo player: court awareness, shot selection under duress, and physical conditioning. For the pair: team coordination and finishing efficiency.

## How to Use These Drills

- **Pick 3-4 drills per session** that target your weakest areas
- **Spend 5-8 minutes per drill** with focused intensity
- **Progress difficulty**: slower feeds → faster feeds → live points
- **Keep score** in competitive drills to add pressure
- **Mix drill types**: combine a volley drill, a wall drill, and a pattern drill for a balanced session

## Key Takeaways

- Partner drills are the fastest path to improvement in padel

- Add scoring and consequences to drills to simulate match pressure
- Rotate through different drill categories each session for well-rounded development
