# The Rulo: Padel's Rising Soft Overhead Weapon

The rulo (Spanish for "roll" or "curl") is a soft, brushing overhead shot that redirects the ball toward the opponent's side fence or glass with heavy topspin and sidespin. Unlike the power smash, bandeja, or vibora, the rulo relies on finesse and spin rather than pace. It has surged in popularity in 2025-2026 professional padel, led by players like Franco Stupaczuk, and is increasingly recognized as one of the most effective and underutilized overhead shots at all levels.

## What Makes the Rulo Unique

The rulo occupies a niche that other overhead shots don't fill:

- **It handles awkward lobs**: Lobs that are slightly behind you or over your outside shoulder -- where a regular smash or vibora is impractical.
- **It maintains net position**: Because the rulo is soft and controlled, you don't need to back up far, keeping you closer to the net.
- **It creates unpredictable bounces**: The heavy spin makes the ball behave erratically off the side glass, making returns extremely difficult.
- **It's lower risk than a smash**: The soft contact and spin-based execution means fewer unforced errors compared to trying to crush the ball.

## When to Use the Rulo

### Ideal Situations
- **Lob over your outside shoulder**: A lob that passes slightly behind you or over the shoulder closest to the side fence.
- **Right-hander on the left side** (or left-hander on the right side): The rulo works best when you can angle the ball toward the side fence naturally.
- **When you're slightly late to the ball**: Instead of lunging for a smash, the rulo's gentle contact allows recovery.
- **Far back in the court after a deep lob**: When you've been pushed back by a quality lob and need to return it without losing the net completely.
- **As a change of pace**: After several bandejas or viboras, a rulo catches opponents off-guard.

### When NOT to Use
- When you have a perfect setup for a flat smash winner -- don't choose finesse when power finishes the point.
- When the lob is directly in front of you -- standard bandeja or vibora are better options.
- When you're too far from the side fence for the angle to work.

## Technique Breakdown

### 1. Preparation and Movement
- Identify the lob and begin moving back, turning your **shoulders toward the side fence**.
- Shuffle steps to maintain balance and keep the ball in view.
- The racket preparation is similar to a kick smash -- **drop your elbow** and cock the racket behind your head.
- Get **underneath and slightly behind** the ball.

### 2. Contact Point
- Contact the ball **above and slightly behind your head**, higher than a bandeja but without the forward commitment of a smash.
- The racket face should be oriented to **brush up and across the ball**, creating a combination of topspin and sidespin.
- Contact is soft -- think of gently rolling the ball rather than striking it.

### 3. The Brushing Motion
- This is the defining element of the rulo. The racket **brushes upward and sideways** across the ball.
- The wrist should be **loose and relaxed**, allowing natural racket head speed through the brushing motion.
- The body stays relatively relaxed throughout -- tension kills the spin.
- The ball leaves the racket with heavy spin but relatively slow pace.

### 4. Follow-Through
- The racket continues in the direction of the brush -- upward and toward the side fence.
- The follow-through should feel natural and unforced.
- Immediately recover to the net after the rulo lands.

## Ball Flight and Bounce Behavior

- The rulo travels in a **slow, looping arc** toward the side glass/fence area.
- After bouncing, the **heavy spin causes the ball to kick unpredictably** -- either climbing up the side glass, dying after the bounce, or changing direction laterally.
- Against the side fence, the ball can become virtually unreturnable because the spin pulls it into the fence at an angle the opponent cannot reach.
- Even if the ball is returned, the spin typically produces a weak, floating response that you can volley aggressively.

## Why It's Becoming More Popular (2025-2026)

Several factors have driven the rulo's rise:

1. **Franco Stupaczuk's influence**: The Argentine player, ranked in the world top 5, has showcased the rulo as a primary weapon, demonstrating its effectiveness at the highest level.

2. **Tactical evolution**: As padel becomes more sophisticated, players and coaches recognize that overhead play needs variety beyond the smash/bandeja/vibora trio.

3. **Gateway to the kick smash**: Coaches increasingly teach the rulo as a **stepping stone to the kick smash**. The brushing technique and relaxed execution build the foundational skills needed for more advanced overhead variations.

4. **Accessibility**: The rulo is **relatively easy to learn** compared to the vibora or kick smash, making it attractive for intermediate players looking to add an overhead option.

5. **Defensive advantage**: The rulo provides an answer to high-quality lobs that would otherwise put the net player at a disadvantage.

## Common Mistakes

- **Hitting too hard**: The rulo is about spin, not power. If you're swinging hard, you've missed the point.
- **Tense wrist and body**: Tension prevents the loose, brushing motion that generates spin. Stay relaxed.
- **Wrong ball selection**: Not every lob suits a rulo. Use it for awkward lobs over the outside shoulder, not for balls right in your power zone.
- **Poor positioning**: Not getting underneath the ball prevents the proper upward brush. Move your feet first.
- **Expecting a winner every time**: The rulo builds pressure and creates weak returns. It's not always a point-ender.

## Drills to Practice

### Drill 1: Shadow Rulo
Without a ball, practice the brushing motion repeatedly. Focus on the loose wrist, the upward-and-sideways brush, and the relaxed follow-through.

### Drill 2: Fed Lob Practice
Have a partner feed lobs slightly over your outside shoulder. Practice rulos targeting the side glass. Focus on spin quality, not pace.

### Drill 3: Game Situation
Play points where the net player must use a rulo instead of a bandeja or smash on every lob over the outside shoulder. This forces shot recognition and builds comfort.
