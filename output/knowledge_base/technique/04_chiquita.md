# The Chiquita Shot: Padel's Precision Weapon to Regain the Net

The chiquita is a soft, low-trajectory shot played from the back of the court that lands at the opponent's feet near the net. Named for its small, delicate nature ("chiquita" means "little one" in Spanish), this shot is one of the most tactically important in modern padel. It is the primary tool players use to transition from defense at the back of the court to offense at the net.

## What Makes the Chiquita Special

In padel, the team that controls the net controls the point. The chiquita exists specifically to **create the opportunity to move forward**. By keeping the ball low at the opponent's feet, you force them to volley upward, producing a weak, lifted return that you can then attack as you arrive at the net.

The chiquita is not about power -- it is about **precision, touch, and timing**.

## Technique Breakdown

### Grip
- Use a **continental grip** for maximum versatility and feel.
- Keep grip pressure **light and relaxed** -- this is a touch shot, and tension kills control.

### Preparation
- Minimal backswing. The chiquita requires **compact preparation** since the ball is usually played off a back-wall bounce.
- Position the racket slightly below the anticipated contact point, ready to brush forward and upward.

### Contact Point
- Contact the ball **slightly in front of your body**, around waist height or lower.
- The racket face should be **slightly open** to create a gentle lift over the net.
- Brush gently forward and slightly upward through the ball -- do not swing through aggressively.

### Ball Flight and Target
- The ball should travel in a **low, gentle arc** that barely clears the net.
- **Primary target**: The opponent's feet, specifically the area around the service line.
- **Secondary targets**: Between the two net players (the "T"), or toward the inside hip of the opponent (harder to volley cleanly).
- The ball should arrive **below net height** after crossing, making it impossible for opponents to volley downward.

### Follow-Through and Transition
- After making contact, **immediately move forward** toward the net. The chiquita is an approach shot.
- Take 2-3 quick steps forward and perform a **split step** as the opponent makes contact with their volley.
- Your follow-through should be short and controlled -- no need for a big finish.

## How Pros Use the Chiquita

Professional players use the chiquita as a **core component of their back-court strategy**:

1. **After a back-wall bounce**: The most common situation. The ball bounces off the back glass, and instead of lobbing, the player plays a chiquita to the opponent's feet and charges the net.

2. **As a change of pace**: After several lobs, a well-placed chiquita catches net players off-guard because they're expecting another high ball.

3. **In four-at-the-net situations**: When all four players are near the net, a mini-chiquita (a dink) at the opponents' feet can break the stalemate.

4. **Cross-court variation**: The cross-court chiquita is the safest option, providing more distance and a better angle to the opponent's feet.

5. **Down-the-line surprise**: A down-the-line chiquita is riskier but highly effective when the near-side opponent is leaning cross-court.

## Tactical Situations

### When to Play the Chiquita
- When opponents are **camped tight at the net** with no space to pass
- When your lobs are being consistently **read and punished**
- When you have time off a **comfortable back-wall bounce**
- When you want to **vary your game** and be unpredictable
- When you are ready to **transition forward** immediately after the shot

### When NOT to Play the Chiquita
- When you are **too rushed** or off-balance to control the touch
- When opponents are **already retreating** (lob instead)
- When the ball is **very low** and you can't generate enough lift to clear the net
- When your partner is not ready to advance with you (a chiquita without advancing is pointless)

## Common Mistakes

- **Too much power**: The chiquita is a finesse shot. Hitting too hard sends the ball above the net player's waist, giving them an easy volley.
- **Not advancing**: Playing a chiquita and staying at the back of the court wastes the shot's purpose.
- **Aiming too high over the net**: The ball must barely clear the net to arrive low at the opponent's feet.
- **Predictability**: Playing a chiquita every time you're at the back wall makes you readable. Mix with lobs, passing shots, and deeper groundstrokes.
- **Tight grip**: Gripping the racket too hard removes the soft touch required for this shot.

## Key Takeaways

- The chiquita is padel's primary tool for transitioning from defense to offense
- Aim at the opponent's feet near the service line to force a weak volley upward
- Use a continental grip with light grip pressure and minimal backswing
- Always advance to the net immediately after playing the chiquita
- Mix the chiquita with lobs and other shots to stay unpredictable
- Cross-court is the safest direction; down-the-line is the surprise variation
