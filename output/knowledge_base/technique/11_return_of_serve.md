# Padel Return of Serve: Positioning, Reading, and Strategy

The return of serve in padel is one of the most important shots in the game. Because the serving team has a natural advantage (the server moves to the net immediately after serving), the receiving team starts every service game at a tactical disadvantage. A strong return neutralizes this advantage and can even turn the tables by forcing the serving team into a defensive position.

## Where to Stand

### The Returner
- Stand approximately **1 meter behind the service line**, giving yourself enough room to react to different serve types.
- Position yourself **slightly toward the center** of your service box to cover both wide and T serves.
- For the deuce side (right box): Stand closer to the center if the server favors T serves; shift wider if they favor slice serves to the glass.
- For the advantage side (left box): Similar adjustments based on the server's tendencies.
- **Stay on the balls of your feet** with knees slightly bent, ready to move in any direction.

### The Returner's Partner
- Stand at approximately the **service line or slightly behind**, ready to move forward with the returner.
- The partner should be prepared to cover the middle and protect against volleys aimed at the gap.
- If the return is a lob, the partner moves back; if the return is low (chiquita-style), the partner moves forward with the returner.

## How to Read the Server

Reading the server's intention gives you a crucial head start:

- **Watch the ball toss/drop**: A ball dropped further from the body often indicates a slice serve. A ball dropped closer to center suggests a flat or body serve.
- **Watch the racket face**: An open face angled to the side indicates slice spin. A square face indicates flat.
- **Watch body alignment**: If the server's shoulders are aimed wide, expect a wide serve. Shoulders aimed at you suggest a body serve.
- **Track patterns**: Most club players have 1-2 preferred serve patterns. After 2-3 service games, you should be able to anticipate their tendencies.
- **First serve vs. second serve**: First serves tend to be more aggressive (faster, more spin). Second serves are usually safer and shorter -- attack them.

## Return Strategies

### 1. The Lob Return (Most Common)

**When to use**: Against strong servers, when the serving team reaches the net quickly, or as a default safe option.

**Execution**:
- Hit a **deep cross-court lob** that pushes the net player back and lands near the back glass.
- Use backspin or flat trajectory -- avoid topspin that assists the overhead player.
- Target depth: beyond the service line, ideally dying near the back wall.

**Why it works**: A deep lob forces the server (who is moving forward) to stop, retreat, and hit an overhead from a defensive position. This neutralizes their net advantage.

### 2. The Chip and Charge (Aggressive)

**When to use**: Against weak second serves, predictable servers, or when you want to take the net immediately.

**Execution**:
- Hit a **low, sliced return** aimed at the server's feet or into the gap between the two net players.
- Use a compact stroke with backspin to keep the ball low.
- Immediately **move forward to the net** behind your return.
- Perform a split step as the server makes contact with their volley.

**Why it works**: A low return at the feet forces the server to volley upward, giving you and your partner the opportunity to take the net and attack.

### 3. The Deep Return (Neutral)

**When to use**: When the serve has moderate pace and you want to start the rally on neutral terms.

**Execution**:
- Drive the ball **deep cross-court** with moderate pace, landing near the opponent's baseline.
- Keep the ball at a medium height -- not high enough for an easy overhead but not so low it sits up.
- This is a rally-starting return that prevents the serving team from attacking immediately.

### 4. The Body Return

**When to use**: When the server is charging the net and you want to create indecision.

**Execution**:
- Aim the return **directly at the incoming server's body** as they approach the net.
- The server must decide between forehand and backhand while moving, often producing a weak response.

## Tactical Principles

### The First 6-8 Shots
Research shows that the serving team's advantage is strongest in the first 6-8 shots of the rally. Your return strategy should focus on **surviving these opening exchanges** and extending the rally, where the advantage equalizes.

### Return Direction
- **Cross-court** is the safest and most effective direction (more distance, better angles).
- **Down the line** is risky but can catch the net player off-guard if they're poaching.
- **At the server** exploits their movement forward and creates body-shot indecision.

### Adapt to Serve Quality
- **Strong first serve**: Prioritize getting the ball back in play. A lob return is perfectly acceptable.
- **Weak second serve**: Attack with a chip and charge or an aggressive deep return.
- **Spin serve to the glass**: Let the ball come off the glass if needed, then lob cross-court deep.

## Common Mistakes

- **Over-hitting the return**: Trying to hit a winner off the serve is almost always wrong. Focus on placement and neutralizing the advantage.
- **Standing too close**: Being too near the service line gives you no time to react. Maintain your buffer zone.
- **Not moving forward**: After a good return, both you and your partner should advance toward the net. Staying back surrenders territory.
- **Ignoring the partner's position**: The returner and partner must move as a unit. If you lob, your partner retreats. If you go low, your partner advances.
- **Same return every time**: Predictability lets the serving team anticipate and punish your returns. Vary between lobs, low returns, and body shots.

## Key Takeaways

- Stand about 1 meter behind the service line, on the balls of your feet
- Read the server's ball drop, racket face, and body alignment for clues
- The lob return is the safest and most effective default option
- Chip and charge on weak second serves to take the net
- Focus on surviving the first 6-8 shots -- the serving advantage fades
- Cross-court returns offer the most margin and best angles
- Always move with your partner as a unit after the return
