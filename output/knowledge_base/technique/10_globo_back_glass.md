# The Globo Off the Back Glass: Lobbing After the Wall Rebound

The globo (lob) off the back glass is one of the most frequently played shots in padel. When your opponents hit a deep ball that bounces off the back wall, your primary response in most situations is to lob it back deep into their court. This shot requires specific footwork, timing, and technique that differs from a regular lob because you are dealing with a ball that has already changed direction off the glass.

## When This Shot Occurs

You will play this shot in several common scenarios:

- After a deep volley from the opposing net team bounces off the back glass
- After a lob from your opponents passes over you and comes off the back wall
- After a serve that kicks deep off the back glass
- Any time you are defending near the back wall and need to reset the point

In all cases, the objective is the same: send a deep, high lob that pushes the opponents away from the net and gives you time to recover your position or advance.

## Footwork: The Foundation

Good footwork is the difference between a strong globo and a weak one that sits up for an easy overhead.

### Positioning Steps
1. **Identify the deep ball early** and begin moving back toward the wall.
2. **Give yourself space** -- stand 1 to 1.5 meters from the back glass so the ball can complete its rebound.
3. **Turn sideways** as the ball approaches, with your non-dominant shoulder pointing toward the net.
4. **Lower your center of gravity** by bending your knees. The ball will often be at hip height or below after the glass rebound.
5. **Set your feet** before the ball arrives. Do not try to lob while still moving backward -- this kills accuracy and power.

### Weight Transfer
- Start with weight on your **back foot** (closer to the wall).
- As you swing, transfer weight to your **front foot** (toward the net).
- This forward weight transfer generates depth on the lob without requiring arm strength.

## Timing the Contact

The timing of contact after the glass rebound is critical:

- **Too early** (as it comes off the glass): You're too close to the wall and cramped.
- **Too late** (after it drops too low): You lose the ability to generate height and depth.
- **Optimal**: Contact the ball at approximately **waist height**, as it is slightly descending after the glass rebound but still at a comfortable striking height.

If the ball comes off the glass with good pace, it will travel further from the wall, giving you more room. If it dies near the wall, you'll need to adjust with a more vertical swing.

## Generating Topspin on the Globo

While flat and backspin lobs are the standard in most situations, topspin lobs off the back glass can be effective in certain circumstances.

### Topspin Technique
- Use a **semi-western or continental grip**, depending on comfort.
- Position the racket **below the ball** during the backswing.
- Swing **low to high**, brushing up the back of the ball with a slightly closed racket face.
- The wrist rolls over the ball at contact, generating forward rotation.
- Follow through **high above your head**, finishing with the racket over your opposite shoulder.

### When to Use Topspin
- When you have time and space (ball comes well off the glass)
- When you want the lob to kick high off the opponent's back glass
- As a variation to keep opponents guessing

### When NOT to Use Topspin
- When you're cramped near the wall (no room for the low-to-high swing)
- When the ball is very low after the rebound (backspin is easier from low positions)
- When opponents smash topspin lobs effectively (the spin can assist their return)

## Flat and Backspin Alternatives

### Flat Globo
- Open racket face, straight low-to-high swing path
- Provides good height and depth with minimal spin
- Reliable in most situations and the default choice for many players

### Backspin Globo
- Open racket face, brushing under the ball with a slight upward motion
- The ball floats through the air with more hang time
- Stays lower after bouncing and dies more quickly
- Best for defensive situations where you need maximum time to recover

## Placement Strategy

- **Cross-court** is the default direction: provides more distance (court diagonal) and more margin for error.
- **Target depth**: The lob should bounce **beyond the service line** and ideally land near the back glass, forcing the opponent into a difficult overhead or back-wall return.
- **Height**: Aim for 4-6 meters high for defensive globos. The higher the lob, the more time you have to recover.
- **Against the weaker overhead player**: If one opponent has a weaker bandeja or smash, consistently lob to their side.

## Common Mistakes

- **Standing too close to the glass**: Leaves no room to swing. Maintain 1-1.5 meters from the wall.
- **Hitting while moving backward**: Set your feet first. A lob hit while retreating will be short and weak.
- **Lob too short**: The most punishing error. A short globo is a gift to the net team. Always err on the side of depth.
- **Only using arms**: Power and depth come from leg drive (pushing upward from bent knees) and weight transfer, not arm strength.
- **Predictable direction**: Always lobbing to the same side makes you readable. Mix cross-court and down-the-line.
- **Rushing the shot**: The glass rebound gives you more time than you think. Be patient, set up properly, and execute.

## Key Takeaways

- The globo off the back glass is padel's most frequent defensive shot -- master it early
- Position yourself 1-1.5 meters from the wall and let the ball complete its rebound
- Contact at waist height using a low-to-high swing with open racket face
- Leg drive and weight transfer create depth -- not arm strength
- Cross-court deep is the safest and most effective direction
- Use backspin for defense and topspin sparingly as an attacking variation
- Always set your feet before swinging -- never lob while moving backward
