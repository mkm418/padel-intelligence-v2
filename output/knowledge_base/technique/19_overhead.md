# Padel Overhead Technique for Intermediate Players: Common Mistakes and How to Fix Them

Overhead shots are the most challenging technical area for intermediate padel players. The transition from being able to play basic groundstrokes and volleys to consistently executing bandejas, viboras, and smashes is where many players plateau. This guide identifies the most common overhead mistakes at the intermediate level and provides concrete fixes for each.

## The Overhead Progression Path

Before diving into mistakes, understand the learning sequence for overheads:

1. **Bandeja** (first): The foundation. A controlled slice overhead that maintains net position.
2. **Flat smash** (second): Power overhead for finishing points.
3. **Vibora** (third): Aggressive sidespin overhead for pressure.
4. **Rulo** (fourth): Soft brushing overhead for awkward positions.

Most intermediate players should focus 80% of their overhead practice on the bandeja. It is the most used overhead in padel at every level.

## Common Mistake #1: Poor Preparation and Late Movement

### The Problem
Intermediate players often freeze when they see a lob coming, then react too late. By the time they start moving, the ball is already over their head, leading to rushed, off-balance shots.

### The Fix
- **Trigger word**: As soon as you identify a lob, say "back" or "lob" out loud. This activates your movement response.
- Begin moving **immediately** using shuffle steps (not crossover steps, which make you lose sight of the ball).
- Get **behind and underneath** the ball so it arrives in front of you, not overhead.
- Your racket should be in the **power position** (up and behind your head) by the time the ball reaches its peak.
- **Drill**: Have a partner feed lobs. Focus only on the movement -- shuffle back, set up, catch the ball with your non-dominant hand. Don't even hit the ball until the footwork feels automatic.

## Common Mistake #2: Loss of Balance (Dropping the Non-Hitting Arm)

### The Problem
Dropping the non-hitting arm too early is the single biggest balance destroyer in overhead technique. When the non-hitting arm drops, the body tilts, the shoulder rotates too early, and the contact point shifts behind the body. This causes the ball to fly long, go into the net, or lack any control.

### The Fix
- **Keep the non-hitting arm pointing at the ball** throughout the preparation and swing.
- The non-hitting arm should stay up until just before contact, then tuck into the body naturally.
- Think of the non-hitting arm as your **tracking system** -- it tells your body where the ball is.
- Your momentum should be directed **toward the court** (forward), not backward or sideways.
- **Drill**: Practice overheads with a deliberate pause in the trophy position (non-hitting arm up, racket cocked behind your head). Hold for a full second before swinging. This builds the habit of keeping the arm up.

## Common Mistake #3: Inconsistent Contact Point

### The Problem
Hitting the ball at different heights and positions relative to the body on every overhead. Sometimes too far behind, sometimes to the side, sometimes too low. This creates wildly inconsistent results.

### The Fix
- The optimal contact point for a bandeja is approximately **eye level to forehead height**, slightly in front of the body.
- For a smash, contact is **above the head at full arm extension**, slightly in front.
- **Consistency comes from footwork**, not arm adjustment. Move your feet to get to the right position rather than reaching with your arm.
- Both arms should work in coordination: as the hitting arm goes up, the non-hitting arm comes down -- like a seesaw.
- **Drill**: Mark a spot on the wall at the correct contact height. Practice the overhead motion hitting that exact spot 50 times. This builds muscle memory for the correct contact position.

## Common Mistake #4: Too Much Power, Not Enough Placement

### The Problem
Intermediate players often try to smash every overhead as hard as possible, resulting in errors, poor glass rebounds that help the opponent, and lost net position.

### The Fix
- **80% of overheads should be bandejas** -- controlled, placed, and slice-based.
- Only smash when you have perfect positioning, the lob is short, and you're balanced.
- On bandejas, focus on **depth and spin** rather than pace. A deep bandeja with slice is more effective than a hard smash that comes back off the glass.
- **Aim for zones**: Cross-court deep, down the line near the glass, or at the opponent's feet. Having a target reduces the temptation to hit aimlessly hard.
- **Drill**: Play points where you are not allowed to hit a full smash -- only bandejas and viboras. This forces placement over power.

## Common Mistake #5: Not Recovering After the Overhead

### The Problem
After hitting an overhead, intermediate players often stand and watch where the ball goes, losing precious time to recover to the net position. This leaves them stranded in the middle of the court.

### The Fix
- The overhead and recovery are **one continuous motion**. Hit the ball, then immediately step forward.
- After every overhead, take **2-3 quick steps toward the net** and perform a split step.
- Train yourself to recover before seeing the result of your shot. Trust your placement and move.
- **Drill**: After each overhead in practice, sprint to touch the net before the opponent returns the ball. This builds the automatic recovery habit.

## Common Mistake #6: Using the Wrong Overhead for the Situation

### The Problem
Trying to hit a full smash on a deep, high lob when a bandeja is more appropriate, or hitting a bandeja on a short, easy lob that deserves a smash.

### The Fix

**Shot Selection Guide**:
| Lob Quality | Your Position | Recommended Overhead |
|------------|---------------|---------------------|
| Short, high | Balanced, under the ball | Flat smash |
| Medium height | At the net | Bandeja |
| Deep, pushing you back | Moving backward | Bandeja (safe option) |
| Over outside shoulder | Slightly late | Rulo or gancho |
| Medium, good position | Want to pressure | Vibora |
| Off-balance | Late to the ball | Bandeja (never smash) |

- **Rule of thumb**: When in doubt, hit a bandeja. It's the safest option and keeps you at the net.

## Common Mistake #7: Wrong Racket Path (Flat Instead of Slice)

### The Problem
Intermediate players often swing through the ball on a flat path, producing bandejas with no spin. Without slice, the ball carries too far and bounces high, giving opponents easy returns.

### The Fix
- The bandeja racket path should go **high-to-low and outside-to-inside**, like wrapping a scarf around your neck.
- The racket face stays **open** (angled upward) throughout the swing.
- Think of **cutting under the ball**, not hitting through it.
- The slice makes the ball float slowly, land deep, and die after bouncing.
- **Drill**: Practice bandejas aiming for a target deep in the court. If the ball bounces past the target and into the glass, you're hitting too flat. Add more slice until the ball lands and dies.

## Practice Framework for Improvement

### Weekly Overhead Practice (30 minutes)

1. **Shadow swings** (5 min): No ball. Practice the full motion -- shuffle back, trophy position, non-hitting arm tracking, contact, recovery.
2. **Fed ball bandejas** (10 min): Partner feeds lobs. Focus on one specific fix from above per session.
3. **Fed ball smashes** (5 min): Partner feeds shorter lobs. Full smash practice.
4. **Live point play** (10 min): Play games where the overhead player must use specific shot selections.

## Key Takeaways

- Master the bandeja before any other overhead -- it's used 80% of the time
- Move early using shuffle steps and get behind the ball before it arrives
- Keep the non-hitting arm up and pointing at the ball for balance and timing
- Contact at eye level for bandejas, full extension for smashes -- consistency comes from footwork
- Prioritize placement and slice over power on most overheads
- Recover to the net immediately after every overhead -- don't admire your shot
- When in doubt, hit a bandeja. It's always the safe choice.
