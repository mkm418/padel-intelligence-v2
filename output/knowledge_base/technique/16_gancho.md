# The Gancho: Padel's Emergency Hook Shot Off the Side Wall

The gancho (Spanish for "hook") is a defensive overhead shot used when a lob passes over your head and you cannot prepare a conventional bandeja, vibora, or smash. Inspired by the basketball hook shot, the gancho involves a looping arm motion that reaches behind and above the body to redirect the ball back into play. It is one of the most spectacular shots in padel and, while primarily defensive, an advanced gancho can put significant pressure on opponents.

## When to Use the Gancho

The gancho is an emergency shot that arises in specific situations:

- **Lob over your head**: A well-placed lob that passes over you while you're at the net, and you don't have time to turn and set up a proper overhead.
- **Maintaining net position**: Rather than retreating to the baseline to play the ball after the bounce, the gancho allows you to stay closer to the net.
- **Balls coming off the side wall**: After a lob bounces off the back glass and rebounds toward the side wall, the gancho can intercept the ball in an otherwise unplayable position.
- **When the bandeja is impossible**: If the ball's trajectory is too far behind you for a bandeja or vibora, the gancho is the alternative.

## Technique Breakdown

### 1. Recognition and Decision

- **Read the lob early**: The moment you realize the lob will pass over you, decide whether to attempt a gancho or retreat.
- The gancho is viable when the ball is **slightly behind or above your non-dominant shoulder**.
- If the ball is too far behind you (more than an arm's length), it's safer to let it bounce and play off the glass.

### 2. Body Position

- **Turn your body in profile** (sideways) to the net, with your hitting shoulder facing backward.
- **Jump** if necessary to reach the ball at its highest point. The gancho often requires a slight leap.
- Your non-hitting arm extends for balance, similar to a basketball hook shot.
- Keep your eyes on the ball throughout the motion.

### 3. The Hooking Arm Motion

This is the gancho's defining characteristic:

- The racket starts from your **ready position in front of your body**.
- The arm loops **behind your body** in a circular motion, passing behind your head.
- Contact occurs **above and behind your head**, approximately over your non-dominant shoulder.
- The wrist is the critical link -- **wrist flexibility** allows you to find the correct angle at the unusual contact point.
- Think of throwing a basketball hook shot: the arm sweeps in an arc from front to back to above.

### 4. Contact Point

- Contact the ball **high on the racket face**, closer to the top edge than the center.
- The racket face should be slightly open to provide lift over the net.
- Contact is typically **above head height** and behind the body axis.
- The touch should be **controlled, not powerful** -- the gancho's goal is to get the ball back in play.

### 5. Follow-Through and Recovery

- The racket continues its arc naturally after contact.
- **Immediately recover** to your net position. The gancho buys time; don't waste it standing still.
- If the gancho is deep enough, advance forward to reclaim the net with a split step.

## Ball Flight Characteristics

When executed well, the gancho produces a distinctive ball flight:

- **Slow pace with slight topspin**: The hooking motion naturally creates a small amount of forward rotation.
- **Deep trajectory**: The ball should travel to the back of the opponent's court.
- **Bounce behavior**: The slight topspin combined with slow pace creates a ball that bounces off the back glass and tends to "die," staying low and close to the wall.
- **Difficult to attack**: Because the ball is slow and deep, opponents cannot easily hit an aggressive overhead.

## Forehand vs. Backhand Gancho

### Forehand Gancho
- More natural and powerful for most players.
- Used when the lob passes over your **dominant-side shoulder** (right shoulder for right-handers).
- The arm motion feels similar to a baseball throw or basketball hook shot.

### Backhand Gancho
- Less common and more difficult.
- Used when the lob passes over your **non-dominant shoulder** (left shoulder for right-handers).
- Requires significant wrist flexibility and practice.
- Many players prefer to run around a backhand gancho and use the forehand version instead.

## Situations from Wall Rebounds

The gancho is particularly useful after wall rebounds:

- **Back glass rebound passing the side**: When a ball bounces off the back glass and angles toward the side wall, the gancho can intercept it before it becomes unplayable.
- **Side wall rebounds at the net**: If a shot ricochets off the side glass near the net at an awkward height, a quick gancho can redirect it.
- **Corner rebounds**: In the tight space of the court corners, the gancho's compact motion works where a full swing cannot.

## Common Mistakes

- **Too much power**: The gancho is a touch shot. Hitting hard causes the ball to fly long or into the side fence.
- **Poor timing**: Attempting the gancho too late (ball too low) or too early (ball still rising) reduces control. Time it at the ball's peak.
- **Stiff wrist**: The wrist must be loose and flexible to find the correct angle at the unusual contact point. A stiff wrist produces flat, misdirected shots.
- **Not jumping**: Many intermediate players try the gancho without leaving the ground. The jump provides the necessary height and reach.
- **Forgetting to recover**: Hitting the gancho and standing still admiring the shot. Immediately move back to the net.
- **Overusing it**: The gancho is an emergency shot, not a first choice. If you can turn and hit a bandeja, always prefer that.

## Drills to Practice

### Drill 1: Basketball Hook Motion
Without a ball, practice the hooking arm motion repeatedly. Stand sideways, loop the racket from front to behind your head, and practice the wrist angle at the top of the motion.

### Drill 2: Partner Lob Feed
Have a partner feed lobs slightly over your head. Practice the gancho from both the forehand and backhand sides. Focus on getting the ball deep over the net, not on power.

### Drill 3: Live Point Integration
Play points where you must attempt a gancho on every lob that passes over your outside shoulder, instead of retreating. This builds comfort with the shot under pressure.

## Key Takeaways

- The gancho is an emergency hook shot for lobs that pass over your head
- It uses a looping arm motion from front to behind the body, with contact above and behind the head
- The wrist is the key link -- keep it loose and flexible for correct angle
- Focus on placement and depth, not power -- the gancho is about staying in the point
- Jump to reach the ball at its highest point
- Always recover to the net immediately after executing the gancho
- Prefer the bandeja or vibora when possible; the gancho is a last resort
