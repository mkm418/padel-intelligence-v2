# The Bandeja Shot: Padel's Essential Overhead Control Shot

The bandeja (Spanish for "tray") is one of the most important and frequently used shots in padel. It is a controlled overhead slice shot that allows the net player to neutralize lobs without giving up their net position. Unlike a smash, the bandeja prioritizes placement, depth, and spin over raw power. Mastering this shot is the gateway to consistent net dominance.

## Grip and Racket Preparation

- Use a **continental grip** (hammer grip), the same used for serves and volleys. This allows natural slice and wrist control.
- Hold the racket at roughly a **45-degree open face angle**, as if you were carrying a tray of drinks -- hence the name.
- The non-hitting hand should point toward the incoming ball for balance, timing, and shoulder rotation.
- Prepare the racket **above and behind the shoulder**, with the elbow bent at approximately 90 degrees.

## Stance and Footwork

- As the lob goes up, **turn sideways** with your non-dominant shoulder facing the net.
- Use **shuffle steps** (not crossover steps) to move backward, keeping your chest oriented toward the play.
- Position yourself so the ball will arrive **slightly in front of your hitting shoulder** -- never directly overhead or behind you.
- Your weight should be on your back foot during preparation, transferring forward as you swing.

## Contact Point and Swing Path

- Make contact at approximately **forehead or eye level**, around the 2 o'clock position relative to your body.
- The swing path moves **high-to-low and outside-to-inside**, creating underspin (slice).
- The racket face stays open throughout the motion, brushing underneath and across the ball.
- Contact should be **in front of your body axis** -- hitting behind you is the most common error and kills control.

## Follow-Through

- The racket finishes across your body, moving toward the **opposite hip**.
- The follow-through should be smooth and controlled, not abrupt. A choppy finish indicates tension.
- Your body should rotate naturally through the shot, with hips and shoulders unwinding together.
- After the shot, immediately **recover to the net position** with a split step.

## When to Use the Bandeja

The bandeja is your **default overhead response** to medium-height lobs. Use it when:

- The lob is too high to volley but not high enough for a full smash
- You want to maintain net position without risking an error
- You need to slow the rally down and keep the ball deep in the opponent's court
- The ball has awkward spin or trajectory that makes a smash risky
- You are slightly off-balance or late to the ball

## Bandeja vs. Vibora: Key Differences

| Aspect | Bandeja | Vibora |
|--------|---------|--------|
| **Intent** | Neutralize and control | Attack and pressure |
| **Spin** | Underspin (slice) | Aggressive sidespin |
| **Contact Point** | In front of body, eye level | Closer to body, slightly higher |
| **Wrist Action** | Minimal, controlled | Strong wrist flick |
| **Ball Flight** | Floats deep, dies after bounce | Slides laterally, accelerates off glass |
| **Target** | Deep center or deep cross-court | Side glass/fence junction |
| **Risk Level** | Low | Medium-high |

Think of the bandeja as the "safe" overhead and the vibora as the "aggressive" overhead. Most points at the net involve more bandejas than viboras.

## Common Mistakes

- **Hitting behind the body**: The most frequent error. If the contact point drifts overhead or behind you, the ball goes long or into the net. Move your feet to stay under and behind the ball.
- **Using too much power**: The bandeja is about control, not power. Swinging hard produces errors and defeats the purpose.
- **Flat racket face**: Failing to keep the face open removes the slice that makes the bandeja effective.
- **Standing still**: Not adjusting footwork to the lob's trajectory results in poor contact.
- **Forgetting recovery**: Hitting the bandeja but not recovering to the net wastes the advantage.

## Key Takeaways

- The bandeja is padel's most important overhead shot -- learn it before the vibora or smash
- Use a continental grip with an open racket face and slice motion (high-to-low)
- Contact the ball in front of your body at eye level
- Prioritize depth and placement over power
- Always recover to the net after hitting
- Choose bandeja for control, vibora for attack, smash for finishing
