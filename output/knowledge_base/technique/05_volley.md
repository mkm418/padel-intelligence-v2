# Padel Volley Fundamentals: Forehand, Backhand, and Net Mastery

The volley is the bread and butter of padel. Because the team that controls the net controls the point, solid volley technique is non-negotiable for competitive play. Unlike tennis, where volleys are situational, in padel you will hit dozens of volleys per set. This guide covers the fundamentals of forehand and backhand volleys, positioning, footwork, and the different volley types.

## The Ready Position

Everything starts with a proper ready position at the net:

- **Racket height**: Hold the racket at **chest height**, with the head above the net line. This reduces reaction time.
- **Grip**: Continental grip (hammer grip) is the standard for both forehand and backhand volleys. It allows quick switching between sides.
- **Stance**: Feet shoulder-width apart, **weight on the balls of your feet**, knees slightly bent.
- **Elbows**: Keep elbows **in front of your body**, not tucked against your sides. This creates a more compact, reactive position.
- **Eyes**: Watch the opponent's racket face at contact to read direction early.

## Forehand Volley

### Technique
- From the ready position, **turn your shoulders slightly** to the forehand side as the ball approaches.
- Step forward with your **left foot** (for right-handers) into the ball. This forward step generates pace and improves reach.
- Keep the racket face **slightly open** (angled upward) to create natural backspin.
- Contact the ball **in front of your body** -- roughly level with your front foot.
- Use a **short, compact stroke** -- a push or punch motion, not a full swing.
- The wrist should remain **firm and stable** through contact.

### Follow-Through
- Short and controlled, finishing slightly across your body.
- Immediately return to the ready position for the next ball.

## Backhand Volley

### Technique
- The backhand volley is typically more challenging but equally important in padel.
- Turn shoulders to the **backhand side** and step forward with your **right foot** (for right-handers).
- Many players use a **two-handed backhand volley** in padel for added stability, especially at lower levels.
- For one-handed backhand volleys, the continental grip is essential for generating the correct angle.
- Contact in front of the body with a slightly open racket face.
- Keep the wrist locked and the racket head **above the wrist** at contact.

### Key Difference from Forehand
- The backhand volley relies more on **placement and depth** than power.
- Focus on directing the ball deep into the opponent's court or at their feet rather than trying to hit winners.

## Body Positioning at the Net

### Ideal Net Position
- Stand approximately **1-2 meters from the net**, depending on the situation.
- Too close to the net: Vulnerable to lobs and shots at your feet.
- Too far from the net: Balls dip below the net line, forcing you to volley up.
- Adjust your depth based on the opponents' tendencies and the rally situation.

### Lateral Position
- Each player covers roughly **half the court**, with slight overlap in the middle.
- When your partner moves to one side, adjust toward the center to cover gaps.
- Maintain a **wall formation** with your partner -- both at the same depth, moving together.

## Footwork Patterns

### Split Step
- The most important footwork element. Perform a **small hop, landing on both feet** just as the opponent makes contact with the ball.
- The split step loads your legs for explosive movement in any direction.
- Time it precisely -- too early or too late reduces its effectiveness.

### Step-and-Hit
- For forehand volleys: **Step with the opposite foot** (left for right-handers) forward and across.
- For backhand volleys: **Step with the dominant foot** (right for right-handers) forward and across.
- The step should be toward the ball and slightly forward, not purely lateral.

### Recovery Steps
- After each volley, take **small adjustment steps** back to the ready position.
- Never stand flat-footed between volleys.

## Types of Volleys

### Block Volley
- A **defensive volley** where you absorb the pace of a fast incoming shot.
- Minimal swing -- just present the racket face and let the ball redirect.
- Used against hard drives and passing shots.

### Push Volley
- A **moderate attacking volley** where you push the ball deep into the opponent's court.
- Creates consistent pressure and keeps opponents pinned at the back.
- The workhorse volley in most rallies.

### Fizz (Spin) Volley
- An **attacking volley** where you add slice or sidespin.
- Creates an awkward bounce that stays low and kicks into the glass.
- Requires more racket head speed and precise timing.

### Drop Volley
- A **soft touch volley** that barely clears the net and dies in the opponent's service box.
- Used when opponents are deep or after a series of hard volleys to change rhythm.
- Requires relaxed hands and excellent touch.

## Common Mistakes

- **Excessive backswing**: The biggest error. Keep the stroke compact -- a long backswing causes late contact and mis-hits.
- **Racket too low**: Letting the racket drop below the net between volleys forces you to swing upward.
- **Flat feet**: Standing flat-footed kills your reaction time. Stay on the balls of your feet with active legs.
- **Arm-only volleys**: Power and control come from the step and body weight transfer, not from arm strength.
- **Not watching the opponent**: Looking at the ball too late. Watch the opponent's racket to anticipate direction.

## Key Takeaways

- Hold the racket at chest height in a continental grip, ready to react
- Use compact, punching strokes -- never take a full swing on a volley
- Step forward into each volley for power and stability
- Split step as the opponent hits to load your movement
- Block fast balls, push for depth, add spin for attacking pressure
- Maintain a wall formation with your partner at consistent net depth
- Practice backhand volleys as much as forehand -- they are equally critical
