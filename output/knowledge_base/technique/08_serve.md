# Padel Serve Technique: Types, Placement, and Strategy

The padel serve is fundamentally different from tennis. It must be hit underhand, at or below waist height, after bouncing the ball behind the service line. While you cannot hit aces or serve-and-volley winners like in tennis, the padel serve is a crucial strategic tool. A well-placed serve with the right spin sets up the point and allows you to transition to the net -- where padel points are won.

## Basic Serve Rules

- The ball must be bounced on the ground behind the service line before striking.
- Contact must occur **at or below waist height**.
- The serve must land in the **diagonal service box** (like tennis).
- After bouncing in the service box, the ball can hit the back or side glass, but **not the fence/cage** (that's a fault).
- You get **two serves** (first and second), and must serve from behind the service line.
- Foot faults apply -- at least one foot must remain behind the line at contact.

## Serve Types

### 1. Flat Serve

**Technique**:
- Drop the ball and strike it with a **relatively flat racket face** using a continental grip.
- Minimal spin -- the ball travels in a direct, predictable path.
- Focus on **pace and depth** to push the receiver back.

**When to Use**:
- As a foundation serve when learning padel
- When you want to rush the receiver and limit their reaction time
- Aimed deep into the service box to reduce the receiver's options

**Pros**: Simple, reliable, good for developing accuracy.
**Cons**: Predictable, no spin to create awkward bounces.

### 2. Slice Serve

**Technique**:
- Use a **continental grip** and brush the **outside edge of the ball** (right side for right-handers).
- The racket moves from right to left across the ball (for right-handers), creating sidespin and backspin.
- Do not "hit" the ball -- **brush it** to generate spin.
- Follow through **across your body** to maintain the spin direction.

**Ball Behavior**: The ball curves through the air, stays low after bouncing, and skids off the side glass at an awkward angle.

**When to Use**:
- To move the receiver wide off the court, opening up the return angle
- To create low, skidding bounces that are difficult to attack
- Against opponents who struggle with low balls or glass-wall returns

**Pros**: Creates angles, stays low, difficult to attack aggressively.
**Cons**: Requires practice to control; easy to fault if the spin is excessive.

**This is the most commonly used serve in professional padel.**

### 3. Kick Serve

**Technique**:
- Brush **up the back of the ball** to create topspin, combined with slight sidespin.
- The racket moves from low to high with a brushing motion.
- Contact is slightly further behind the ball than the flat serve.

**Ball Behavior**: The ball bounces higher than expected and kicks upward off the glass, disrupting the receiver's timing.

**When to Use**:
- Against shorter players who struggle with high balls
- As a variation to disrupt rhythm after several slice serves
- When targeting the back glass to create a high, awkward rebound

**Pros**: Creates unpredictable bounces, high rebound off glass.
**Cons**: Higher trajectory makes it easier to read if overused.

### 4. Body Serve

**Technique**:
- Any spin type, but **aimed directly at the receiver's body** (hip or midsection).
- The receiver must decide quickly between forehand and backhand, often resulting in a cramped, weak return.

**When to Use**:
- Against receivers who have strong returns to either side but struggle with body shots
- To create indecision and weak, floating returns
- As a tactical surprise after serving wide or into corners

**Pros**: Creates indecision, limits aggressive returns, safe option.
**Cons**: Can be punished by receivers who recognize it early.

## Where to Aim and Why

### Deuce Side (Right Box)
- **Wide to the glass**: Pulls the receiver off the court, opening space for your partner's volley. Best with a slice serve.
- **Into the body**: Creates indecision. Particularly effective against right-handed players whose backhand is jammed.
- **Down the T (center)**: Limits the receiver's angle for the return. Good for setting up a straightforward first volley.

### Advantage Side (Left Box)
- **Wide to the glass**: Targets the receiver's backhand (for right-handers). The slice kicks off the side glass uncomfortably.
- **Into the body**: Again creates indecision, especially effective at the intermediate level.
- **Down the T**: Reduces return angles and makes your life easier at the net.

## The Primary Goal: Get to the Net

The most important thing about the padel serve is not the serve itself but what happens immediately after. The serve should:

1. **Land consistently** -- a double fault is the worst outcome
2. **Create a weak return** -- through spin, placement, or pace
3. **Give you time to reach the net** -- where you want to be for the first volley

After serving, take **2-3 quick steps forward** and arrive near the service line for a split step as the receiver makes contact. Your net position after the serve is more important than the serve quality itself.

## Common Mistakes

- **Hitting too hard**: Power serves rarely work in padel. Focus on placement and spin.
- **Ball toss/drop inconsistency**: A wobbly or inconsistent ball drop creates inconsistent serves. Practice dropping the ball from the same height and position every time.
- **Not moving to the net**: Serving and staying at the baseline surrenders the net to the receiving team.
- **Same serve every time**: Predictability allows receivers to anticipate and attack. Mix up spin, direction, and pace.
- **Illegal contact height**: Hitting above the waist results in a fault. Keep your body low if needed to maintain legal contact.

## Key Takeaways

- The slice serve is the most effective and commonly used serve in padel
- Placement and spin matter far more than power
- Always move forward to the net after serving
- Mix serve types and directions to keep opponents guessing
- The body serve is an underused tactic that creates indecision
- A consistent, deep serve is more valuable than an aggressive, erratic one
