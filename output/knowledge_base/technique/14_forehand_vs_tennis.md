# Padel Forehand vs. Tennis Forehand: Key Differences

For the millions of tennis players transitioning to padel, the forehand is both familiar and deceptively different. While the basic concept of hitting a forehand remains -- strike the ball on your dominant side with a forward swing -- the grip, swing path, power generation, and follow-through in padel require significant adjustments. Understanding these differences early prevents bad habits and accelerates your padel development.

## Grip Differences

### Tennis Forehand Grip
- Most tennis players use a **semi-western or western grip** for topspin forehands.
- The hand sits further under the racket handle, enabling heavy topspin generation.
- Some use an eastern grip for flatter shots.

### Padel Forehand Grip
- The **continental grip** (hammer grip) is the standard in padel for most shots, including the forehand.
- Some players use a **semi-western grip** for forehand groundstrokes, especially when hitting from comfortable positions.
- The continental grip is more versatile in padel because you need to switch quickly between forehands, backhands, volleys, and overheads without changing grip.
- The wrist is angled at approximately **90 degrees to the forearm**, keeping the racket face more vertical initially.

### Why This Matters
In tennis, you have time between shots to adjust your grip. In padel, the faster rally pace (smaller court, four walls) and constant net play mean you need a grip that works for multiple shot types. The continental grip sacrifices some forehand topspin but gains enormous versatility.

## Swing Path Differences

### Tennis Forehand Swing
- **Long backswing**: The racket goes back to at least shoulder height, often with a full loop.
- **Low-to-high path**: The swing moves from below the ball upward through contact, generating heavy topspin.
- **Full rotation**: The body rotates significantly, with the hips and shoulders unwinding to generate power.
- **Extended follow-through**: The racket finishes high over the opposite shoulder.

### Padel Forehand Swing
- **Short backswing**: The racket goes back only to about **hip or waist height**. There is no big loop or full wind-up.
- **More horizontal path**: The swing is flatter and more horizontal compared to tennis, pushing through the ball rather than lifting it.
- **Compact rotation**: Body rotation is used but is less dramatic than tennis. Power comes more from weight transfer and timing.
- **Controlled follow-through**: The racket finishes in front of the body, not over the opposite shoulder. Some describe it as "pushing through the back of the ball."

### Why the Swing Is Shorter
- **Smaller court**: You have less space and less time between shots. A long backswing creates timing problems.
- **Different ball**: Padel balls have less pressure than tennis balls, so they don't travel as fast. You don't need as much racket head speed.
- **Wall rebounds**: Balls coming off the glass require quick reactions. A compact swing allows earlier preparation and faster contact.
- **Control over power**: In padel, accuracy and placement win more points than raw power. The shorter swing provides more control.

## Contact Point

### Tennis
- Contact is typically **out in front of the body** with the arm fully extended.
- The contact point is further from the body because the longer swing generates centrifugal force.

### Padel
- Contact is also in front of the body but **closer to the body** than in tennis.
- Ideally at **knee to waist level**, depending on the ball height.
- The racket face is aligned with the target at contact -- you're "pushing" toward where you want the ball to go.
- Keeping the racket face pointing at the target through contact is more important than in tennis.

## Follow-Through

### Tennis
- High, over-the-shoulder finish with full arm extension.
- The racket wraps around the body, finishing near the opposite hip or shoulder.
- The follow-through helps generate topspin and complete the kinetic chain.

### Padel
- The follow-through is **shorter and more forward**.
- The racket finishes in front of the body, pointing generally toward the target.
- There is less wrap-around because the swing is more horizontal and compact.
- The quick recovery to the ready position is prioritized over a dramatic follow-through.

## Power Generation

### Tennis
- Power comes from the full kinetic chain: legs, hips, trunk rotation, shoulder, arm, and wrist.
- The long swing path and heavy topspin add pace through racket head speed.

### Padel
- Power comes primarily from **weight transfer** (back foot to front foot) and **timing**.
- Body rotation contributes but is more subtle than in tennis.
- The racket itself is solid (no strings), so there's no trampoline effect. You must rely on clean contact and body mechanics.
- **Placement and depth** are more valuable than pace in padel.

## Practical Adjustments for Tennis Players

### What to Keep
- **Footwork fundamentals**: Split step, ready position, and balanced movement are identical.
- **Shoulder turn**: Turning sideways to prepare is still essential.
- **Weight transfer**: Loading the back foot and driving forward remains the power source.
- **Eye on the ball**: Tracking the ball through contact is universal.

### What to Change
- **Shorten your backswing** immediately. If it feels too short, it's probably about right for padel.
- **Flatten your swing path**. Less low-to-high topspin; more horizontal push through the ball.
- **Switch to continental grip** for all-around play, or allow a semi-western for forehands only.
- **Reduce power**: Hit at 60-70% of your tennis power. Focus on where, not how hard.
- **Prepare earlier**: The ball arrives faster in padel (smaller court). Early preparation is non-negotiable.
- **Shorten follow-through**: Finish in front of you, recover quickly to the ready position.

## Common Mistakes Tennis Players Make

- **Full tennis swing**: The long backswing and over-the-shoulder follow-through cause late contact and overhitting in padel.
- **Too much topspin**: Heavy topspin lifts the ball too high in padel's smaller court, giving opponents easy overheads.
- **Trying to hit winners**: Padel rewards patience and placement over aggressive shot-making. Points are constructed, not won in one shot.
- **Western grip on every shot**: A heavy western grip makes it impossible to volley, serve, or hit overheads effectively. Switch to continental.
- **Ignoring the walls**: Tennis players often treat the back glass as a fence (out of play). In padel, the ball is still live after hitting the glass.

## Key Takeaways

- Use a continental grip in padel for versatility across all shots
- Shorten your backswing dramatically -- compact preparation is essential
- Swing more horizontally, "pushing" through the ball rather than lifting with topspin
- Prioritize placement and depth over power
- The follow-through is shorter and finishes in front of the body
- Tennis footwork fundamentals (split step, weight transfer) still apply perfectly
- Adjust your mindset: padel rewards consistency and construction over aggressive winners
