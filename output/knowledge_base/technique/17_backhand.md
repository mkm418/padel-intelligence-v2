# Two-Handed vs. One-Handed Backhand in Padel: Complete Guide

The backhand in padel is one of the most debated technique topics. Unlike tennis, where the two-handed backhand has become dominant at the professional level, padel sees significant use of both one-handed and two-handed variations. Each has distinct advantages and disadvantages, and the choice between them depends on your playing style, physical attributes, and the situations you encounter most frequently on court.

## One-Handed Backhand

### Technique
- Use a **continental grip** with the dominant hand.
- The racket is held with one hand throughout the stroke, with the non-dominant hand assisting only during preparation (supporting the racket throat).
- Turn your shoulders sideways, with your hitting arm extending across your body.
- Contact the ball **in front of your body**, further forward than the two-handed contact point.
- The swing path is relatively compact, pushing through the ball with the racket face aligned to the target.
- Follow through forward and slightly upward, finishing with the racket pointing toward the target area.

### Advantages
- **Greater reach**: The extended arm provides significantly more reach, which is critical for wide balls, low shots near the walls, and stretching for difficult returns.
- **Ideal for low balls**: When the ball bounces low off the glass or after a slice, the one-handed backhand naturally allows you to get down to the ball by extending the arm and bending the knees.
- **Superior for lobs**: The one-handed backhand provides a smoother motion for lob shots, especially from low contact points.
- **Natural slice ability**: The one-handed grip and swing path naturally produce backspin, which is one of the most useful spins in padel for keeping the ball low.
- **Smooth volley transition**: The continental grip used for the one-handed backhand is the same grip used for volleys, creating a seamless transition at the net.
- **Energy conservation**: Using one arm requires less physical effort per shot, which matters over long matches and tournaments.
- **Wall play advantage**: In tight positions near the glass, the one-handed backhand's compact motion and extra reach are valuable.

### Disadvantages
- **Less power**: Generating pace with one arm is harder, especially against fast-incoming balls.
- **Less stability**: The single-arm connection to the racket provides less structural stability on off-center hits.
- **Difficulty with high balls**: One-handed backhands struggle with balls at shoulder height or above, particularly in the backhand corner.

## Two-Handed Backhand

### Technique
- The dominant hand uses a continental grip; the non-dominant hand is placed above it in an eastern forehand position.
- Both hands grip the racket throughout the entire stroke.
- The swing involves **coordinated body rotation** with both arms working together.
- Contact the ball slightly closer to the body compared to the one-handed version.
- Both arms drive through the ball, generating power from the rotation of hips and shoulders.
- Follow through over the shoulder on the non-dominant side.

### Advantages
- **More power**: Two arms generate significantly more force than one, allowing harder drives and passing shots.
- **Better control and consistency**: The second hand stabilizes the racket, producing more consistent contact and better directional control.
- **Handles high balls well**: Two hands provide the stability needed to manage balls at chest or shoulder height, which are common in padel after glass rebounds.
- **Stronger against pace**: When opponents are driving hard at your backhand, two hands absorb and redirect the pace more effectively.
- **Better for beginners**: The added stability makes it easier for new players to develop consistent technique.

### Disadvantages
- **Reduced reach**: Both hands on the racket shortens your effective reach by 15-20 centimeters compared to one hand.
- **Difficulty with low balls**: Getting down to very low balls requires more body adjustment because the arms are together.
- **Slower grip transitions**: Switching from a two-handed backhand to a volley grip requires a quick hand adjustment.
- **More tiring**: Using both arms on every backhand accumulates more fatigue over a long match.
- **Tight spaces near walls**: In cramped positions near the glass, the two-handed swing can feel restricted.

## When Each Is Preferred

### Choose One-Handed When:
- You play primarily on the **right side** (deuce side), where more balls come to the backhand in defensive situations requiring reach
- You frequently hit **slice shots** and lobs from the back of the court
- You rely on a **net-first game** and want seamless transitions to backhand volleys
- You play in **tight spaces near walls** where reach and compact motion matter
- You prioritize **energy management** in long matches
- You have experience from **tennis with a one-handed backhand**

### Choose Two-Handed When:
- You play primarily on the **left side** (advantage side), where the backhand is used more for drives and passing shots
- You face opponents who **drive hard at your backhand** and need stability
- You need **power on backhand groundstrokes** to push opponents back
- You are a **beginner or intermediate player** building consistent technique
- You frequently handle **high-bouncing balls** that come off the glass at chest height
- You have experience from **tennis with a two-handed backhand**

## The Professional Perspective

At the professional level, the choice often depends on the player's position:

- **Right-side players**: More commonly use the one-handed backhand for reach, slice, and defensive flexibility.
- **Left-side players**: More commonly use the two-handed backhand for power, drives, and the ability to handle pace.
- **Many pros use both**: Some advanced players switch between one-handed and two-handed depending on the specific shot situation, using one hand for slice and volleys, and two hands for drives and returns.

## Hybrid Approach

An increasingly popular approach is to use **both techniques situationally**:

- **One-handed for**: Volleys, slice shots, lobs, low balls, stretched positions near walls
- **Two-handed for**: Drives, returns of serve, high balls, passing shots, power situations

This hybrid approach requires more practice but provides the most complete backhand game.

## Common Mistakes (Both Types)

- **Not preparing early**: Late shoulder turn and racket preparation is the most common backhand error.
- **Swinging too big**: Like the forehand, padel backhands should be compact. Long swings cause timing problems.
- **Contact behind the body**: Letting the ball get past the front foot results in weak, misdirected shots.
- **Stiff legs**: Not bending the knees, especially for low balls. Leg bend is essential for clean contact.
- **Ignoring the non-dominant hand**: For one-handed backhands, the non-dominant hand should actively support and guide during preparation.

## Key Takeaways

- Neither one-handed nor two-handed is inherently "better" -- each has clear advantages
- One-handed: more reach, better slice, smoother volley transition, ideal for wall play
- Two-handed: more power, more stability, handles high balls better, good for beginners
- Right-side players often prefer one-handed; left-side players often prefer two-handed
- Consider a hybrid approach: one hand for slice/volleys, two hands for drives/power
- The most important factor is consistent contact in front of the body, regardless of style
