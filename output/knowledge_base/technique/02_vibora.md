# The Vibora: Padel's Aggressive Sidespin Overhead

The vibora (Spanish for "viper") is an aggressive overhead shot that generates heavy sidespin, causing the ball to slide laterally after bouncing and accelerate off the side glass. It is the attacking evolution of the bandeja and one of the most devastating weapons in professional padel. When executed correctly, the vibora creates angles that are nearly impossible to return cleanly.

## Step-by-Step Mechanics

### 1. Read and Move Early

- As soon as you identify the incoming lob, begin moving backward using **shuffle steps** while keeping your chest facing the play.
- Early movement is critical -- the vibora requires precise positioning, and late movement ruins the shot.
- Track the ball with your non-hitting hand pointing upward for balance and timing.

### 2. Body Position and Preparation

- Turn your body **more sideways** than for a bandeja, with your hitting shoulder further back.
- The racket should be **cocked high behind your head**, elbow bent, wrist loaded.
- Your weight should sit on the back foot, ready to transfer forward and rotate through the shot.
- The preparation should be "frozen" -- racket still and stable before the swing begins.

### 3. Contact Point

- Hit the ball **closer to your body** than a bandeja -- approximately above or slightly behind your hitting shoulder.
- Contact is **higher** than a bandeja, typically at or above head height.
- The racket face is slightly more closed than a bandeja, allowing the sidespin generation.
- The ball should be struck just as it reaches its **peak or slightly after**.

### 4. The Swing: Generating Sidespin

- The swing path moves **high-to-low with a pronounced lateral component** (outside-to-inside for right-handers).
- Engage a **strong wrist flick** at the point of contact -- this is what differentiates the vibora from the bandeja.
- Use your **shoulders and core rotation**, not just the wrist, for power and consistency.
- The racket brushes aggressively across and under the ball, imparting heavy sidespin.

### 5. Follow-Through

- The racket continues across and down toward the opposite hip.
- The follow-through should feel natural and complete -- stopping short indicates tension.
- Immediately recover to your net position with a split step.

## Targeting and Ball Flight

- **Primary target**: The junction between the side glass and the fence (the "reja"). The sidespin makes the ball slide along the glass and accelerate unpredictably.
- **Cross-court vibora**: Travels diagonally, hitting the side wall and kicking toward the back glass.
- **Down-the-line vibora**: Faster but less margin for error. Used to surprise or when the angle is clear.
- The ball should bounce in the **service box area** and then kick laterally into the glass.

## Common Mistakes

- **Hitting too far from the body**: Contact point too far forward turns the vibora into a flat bandeja. The vibora requires a closer, higher contact.
- **All wrist, no shoulder**: Over-relying on wrist action without engaging the shoulder and core produces inconsistent results and risks injury.
- **Overhitting**: Trying to hit a winner every time. The vibora is a pressure tool, not always a finishing shot. Build the point.
- **Poor preparation**: Being "floppy" with the racket or not freezing the preparation before the swing leads to mis-hits.
- **Wrong ball selection**: Not every lob deserves a vibora. If you're off-balance, late, or the ball is too low, default to a bandeja.

## Drills to Practice

### Drill 1: Wall Target Practice
Stand at the net and have a partner feed medium-height lobs. Practice hitting viboras targeting a specific spot on the side wall. Focus on consistent sidespin direction.

### Drill 2: Freeze and Fire
Have a partner feed lobs while you focus exclusively on freezing the racket preparation before swinging. This builds the muscle memory for stable preparation.

### Drill 3: Shoulder Rotation Focus
Practice viboras while consciously minimizing wrist action and maximizing shoulder rotation. This builds a more reliable base before adding wrist refinement.

### Drill 4: Game Situation Points
Play points starting from a lob feed. The net player must choose between bandeja and vibora based on the lob quality. This trains shot selection under pressure.

## Key Takeaways

- The vibora is an advanced overhead that generates heavy sidespin and lateral movement off the glass
- Contact closer to the body and higher than a bandeja, with a strong wrist flick and shoulder rotation
- Target the side glass/fence junction to maximize the spin effect
- Master the bandeja first -- the vibora is its aggressive evolution
- Don't overhit; use the vibora to build pressure, not always to finish
- Early movement and frozen racket preparation are non-negotiable fundamentals
