# The Future of Padel 2026-2030: Olympics, Global Expansion, Technology & Market Projections

Padel is the world's fastest-growing racquet sport, and the period from 2026 to 2030 will be transformative for the industry. From Olympic inclusion prospects to AI-powered smart courts, massive market growth, and expansion into new continents, padel stands at an inflection point. Here is what the next five years hold.

## Olympic Inclusion Prospects

### 2028 Los Angeles: Not in the Program
Padel will **not** be included in the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics. The IOC's decision deadline for the LA28 sports program has passed, and while discussions about reopening the padel file have occurred, the primary barrier is geopolitical: American athletes have virtually no chance of medaling, which conflicts with the US Olympic Committee's hosting priorities.

### 2032 Brisbane: The Target
**Brisbane 2032 is the earliest realistic opportunity** for padel's Olympic debut. The sport has strong momentum heading into the decision window:

- **ARISF status achieved**: The FIP holds Association of IOC Recognised International Sport Federations status, a crucial prerequisite for Olympic inclusion
- **Anti-doping compliance**: Full World Anti-Doping Code compliance is in place
- **Asia-Pacific growth**: Initiatives like the Pacific Cup (launched in Tahiti, 2025) support the regional growth needed for an Australian Games
- **IOC program decisions for Brisbane** typically cluster around 2028-2029, giving padel several years to strengthen its case

### Remaining Hurdles
The main challenge is meeting the IOC's geographic distribution requirements:
- **Men's**: Must be played in at least **75 countries across 4 continents**
- **Women's**: Must be played in at least **40 countries across 3 continents**

As of 2025, padel is present in over 110 countries, but competitive depth in many of those nations remains thin. The FIP is actively working to develop padel infrastructure in Africa, Asia, and Oceania to meet these thresholds convincingly.

## Global Expansion (2026-2030)

### Current Scale
- **77,000+ padel courts** worldwide (up 15.2% year-over-year in 2025)
- **35+ million active players** globally
- Present in **150 nations and 20 dependent territories**

### Key Growth Markets

**United Kingdom**
The UK saw a **116% increase in padel court facilities** between 2022 and 2023, with 250 new courts built. The addition of London to the 2026 Premier Padel calendar signals the sport's growing prominence in this market. The Lawn Tennis Association (LTA) has formally adopted padel governance, providing institutional support.

**United States**
Still an emerging market, but growing rapidly in cities like Miami, New York, Dallas, and Los Angeles. The US market represents the largest untapped opportunity for padel globally. Private investment in padel facilities accelerated through 2025, with several large-scale club developments underway.

**Middle East**
Qatar's title sponsorship of the Premier Padel Tour and Saudi Arabia hosting the season-opening P1 event in Riyadh reflect the region's commitment to padel. Investment in both facilities and professional events is substantial and growing.

**Africa**
The addition of Pretoria (South Africa) to the 2026 Premier Padel calendar marks the continent's first top-tier padel event. Africa represents a critical growth frontier for meeting Olympic geographic requirements.

**Asia-Pacific**
Still in early stages, but strategic initiatives like the Pacific Cup and growing interest in countries like Japan, Australia, and India position the region for growth through 2030.

### Projected Growth
- **Courts**: Expected to surpass **100,000 globally** by 2028, up from 77,000 in 2025
- **Players**: Projected to exceed **50 million active players** by 2030
- **Countries**: Target of competitive padel in **100+ countries** to strengthen the Olympic bid

## Technology Integration

Technology is rapidly transforming both professional and recreational padel.

### AI-Powered Video Analysis
- **Automated shot tracking**: Systems like Svila AI and PadelCourt use computer vision to track shot placement, speed, spin, and movement patterns without manual input
- **Performance analytics**: Rally length, court coverage, shot selection patterns, and win probability models are becoming available at club level
- **Research advancement**: PadelTracker100, a dataset for intelligent player and ball tracking published in 2025, is accelerating academic and commercial AI development in the sport

### Smart Court Infrastructure
- **Automated recording**: QR-code-activated video recording systems that require no manual setup or app downloads
- **Instant highlights**: AI-generated highlight reels and lowlights available immediately after matches
- **Live streaming**: Cloud-based streaming from any equipped court, enabling content creation at scale
- **Facility automation**: Courts with automated lighting, climate control, and access systems that activate upon booking, enabling unmanned 24/7 operations

### Club Management Platforms
- Integrated booking, payments, membership management, and academy scheduling systems
- Smart access control via QR codes, RFID cards, and mobile apps
- Revenue optimization through data-driven pricing and capacity management

### Wearable Technology
- Smartwatch companion apps for real-time match scoring, play notifications, and social sharing
- Heart rate and movement tracking integration for training load monitoring
- Emerging integration with on-court analytics systems for comprehensive performance profiles

### Revenue Models
Smart court providers like Svila AI offer **zero-cost installation** for selected clubs, generating revenue through player subscriptions (approximately EUR 5 per video unlock). This model aligns club and technology provider incentives, accelerating adoption.

## Market Projections

### Financial Scale
- **2026**: The padel industry is projected to reach **EUR 6 billion** globally (Playtomic/Deloitte report)
- **2030**: Market expected to exceed **EUR 10 billion**, driven by facility construction, equipment sales, technology platforms, media rights, and tournament revenue
- The professional tour's media rights value is growing as broadcast partnerships expand across Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East

### Investment Trends
- Private equity and venture capital interest in padel clubs, technology platforms, and equipment brands continues to accelerate
- Consolidation of club management platforms and booking systems is expected
- Media rights for Premier Padel events represent a growing revenue stream
- Equipment market growing rapidly with major tennis brands (Head, Babolat, Wilson, Adidas) investing heavily in padel-specific product lines

## Challenges & Risks

Despite the optimistic outlook, several challenges could affect padel's growth trajectory:

- **Market saturation in Spain**: The largest padel market may be approaching facility saturation in urban areas
- **Prize money inequality**: Significant gaps between men's and women's prize money could create governance issues
- **Governance fragmentation**: Historical tensions between competing professional tours (now largely resolved through Premier Padel/FIP unification) could resurface
- **Facility quality**: Rapid expansion risks inconsistent court quality and player experience across markets
- **Weather dependence**: Outdoor facilities in northern climates face seasonal limitations, making indoor court investment critical

## Key Takeaways

- Brisbane 2032 is the most likely target for padel's Olympic debut, contingent on meeting geographic distribution requirements
- The global market is projected to reach EUR 6 billion by 2026 and could exceed EUR 10 billion by 2030
- Court count is growing at 15%+ annually, with 77,000+ courts worldwide and a target exceeding 100,000 by 2028
- The UK, US, Middle East, and Africa are the key growth markets for the next five years
- AI-powered video analysis and smart court infrastructure are transforming both professional and recreational padel
- Technology adoption is accelerating through zero-cost installation models that align club and provider incentives
