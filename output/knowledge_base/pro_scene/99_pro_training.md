# How Professional Padel Players Train: Routines, Coaching, Physical Preparation & Match Scheduling

Professional padel demands a multifaceted training approach that blends on-court technical work, physical conditioning, tactical study, and mental preparation. As the sport has professionalized rapidly through the Premier Padel circuit, the training standards have evolved to match those of top-tier racquet sports. Here is how the world's best padel players structure their preparation.

## A Typical Training Day

Based on the routines of elite players including former world champion Fernando Belasteguin, a professional padel player's typical training day follows this structure:

| Time | Activity |
|------|----------|
| 7:00-7:30 | Wake up, light breakfast (fruit, oats, coffee) |
| 8:30-10:30 | Physical training session (gym, agility, conditioning) |
| 11:00-13:00 | On-court padel training with coach, followed by stretching |
| 13:30-14:30 | Lunch and recovery |
| 14:30-16:00 | Rest, video analysis, or tactical study |
| 16:00-17:30 | Second on-court session (match simulation or specific drills) |
| 18:00-19:00 | Recovery protocols (massage, cold therapy, physiotherapy) |
| 20:00-21:00 | Dinner |
| 22:00-22:30 | Bedtime |

Sleep is treated as a non-negotiable training pillar. Top players aim for **7.5 to 8 hours** nightly, recognizing that sleep quality directly impacts muscle recovery, reaction time, and decision-making on court.

## Physical Preparation

Modern padel demands athlete-level conditioning. The physical preparation breaks down into several key components:

### Strength Training (3x per week, 30-60 minutes)
- Lower body emphasis: squats, lunges, and lateral movements to support the constant direction changes in padel
- Core stability work: essential for rotational power in shots like the bandeja and vibora
- Upper body: shoulder stability and rotator cuff work to prevent overuse injuries, especially for smash-heavy players
- Resistance bands and functional movement patterns that replicate on-court demands

### Speed & Agility (2-3x per week)
- Agility ladder drills for foot speed and coordination
- Cone drills emphasizing lateral movement and recovery
- Short sprint intervals (5-10m) simulating explosive court movements
- Skipping rope for footwork rhythm and cardiovascular conditioning

### Cardiovascular Conditioning
- A mix of aerobic base training (steady-state running, cycling) and anaerobic intervals
- High-intensity interval training (HIIT) that mirrors the stop-start nature of padel rallies
- Typical padel matches last 60-90 minutes with constant movement, requiring both endurance systems

### Flexibility & Mobility
- Daily stretching routines, both dynamic (pre-training) and static (post-training)
- Yoga sessions for flexibility, balance, and mental focus
- Foam rolling and mobility work targeting hips, shoulders, and thoracic spine

## On-Court Technical Training

Professional padel training sessions are highly structured and typically focus on specific aspects of the game:

### Drill Categories
- **Serve and return patterns**: Practicing specific serve placements and first-ball responses
- **Net play**: Volley sequences, bandeja and vibora technique, smash accuracy
- **Wall play**: Reading glass rebounds, defensive lobs off the back wall, side-wall attacks
- **Point construction**: Building rallies from specific court positions
- **Match simulation**: Playing points under competitive conditions with coaching feedback

### Coaching Sessions (3-4x per week)
- Typically led by a dedicated coach who travels with the pair during the tour
- Focus alternates between technical refinement, tactical preparation, and match review
- Video analysis of upcoming opponents is standard preparation before tournament matches

## The Coaching Team

Elite padel players operate within a multidisciplinary support team:

- **Head coach**: Tactical and technical direction, match strategy, pair dynamics
- **Physical trainer**: Strength, conditioning, and periodization of training loads
- **Physiotherapist**: Injury prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation
- **Nutritionist**: Meal planning, hydration strategies, and tournament nutrition
- **Sports psychologist**: Mental preparation, pressure management, and pair communication
- **Video analyst**: Opponent scouting and performance review (increasingly common at the top level)

The head coach is often the most critical hire, as they must manage both the tactical development and the interpersonal dynamics between partners. Pair chemistry is everything in padel, and a coach's role in mediating and optimizing that relationship cannot be overstated.

## Recovery Protocols

Recovery is as important as training for professional padel players who compete in 20-26 tournaments per year:

- **Massage therapy**: Deep tissue and sports massage after training sessions and matches
- **Cold water immersion**: Ice baths or cold plunge pools to reduce inflammation
- **EMS (Electrical Muscle Stimulation)**: Used for active recovery and muscle activation
- **Compression therapy**: Recovery boots and compression garments between sessions
- **Sauna sessions**: Heat therapy for circulation and relaxation
- **Physiotherapy**: Regular maintenance treatments targeting problem areas (shoulders, knees, lower back)

## Pre-Season Structure

The professional padel pre-season typically lasts **6-8 weeks** and runs from late November through January, before the season opens in February:

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-3)
- High-volume physical conditioning
- Aerobic base building
- Strength training with progressive overload
- Basic on-court work to rebuild rhythm

### Phase 2: Intensification (Weeks 3-5)
- Increased intensity with sport-specific conditioning
- Technical refinement of key shots
- Tactical preparation with new partner (if applicable)
- Match simulation under competitive conditions

### Phase 3: Competition Preparation (Weeks 6-8)
- Tournament-simulated training matches
- Fine-tuning tactical game plans
- Tapering physical load to peak for season opener
- Mental preparation and goal setting for the year

The pre-season is particularly critical when players change partners, as pairs need to establish court chemistry, communication patterns, and shared tactical understanding before competition begins.

## Match Scheduling & Tournament Life

Professional padel players face a demanding competitive calendar:

- **20-26 tournaments per year** across the Premier Padel circuit
- Tournaments typically run **5-7 days** including qualifying rounds
- Top seeds may play **3-5 matches** per tournament
- Travel between events spanning Europe, Middle East, Americas, and Africa
- Recovery days between tournaments are carefully managed to avoid burnout

Players must strategically choose which events to enter based on ranking points, physical condition, and the competitive calendar. The FIP Race Ranking rewards consistency across the season, incentivizing participation in as many events as possible while managing physical load.

## Key Takeaways

- Professional padel players train 4-6 hours daily, split between physical conditioning and on-court work
- Sleep (7.5-8 hours) and recovery protocols are treated as essential training components, not afterthoughts
- A multidisciplinary support team (coach, physio, nutritionist, psychologist, physical trainer) is standard at the elite level
- Pre-season lasts 6-8 weeks and is critical for building fitness foundations and pair chemistry
- The competitive calendar demands strategic tournament selection to balance performance and physical longevity
- Video analysis and tactical preparation for opponents have become standard practice at the top level
