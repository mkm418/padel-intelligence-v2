# Premier Padel Tour 2025-2026: Format, Tournaments, Prize Money & Qualification

The Premier Padel Tour is the top-tier professional padel circuit, operated in partnership with the International Padel Federation (FIP) and backed by Qatar Airways as title sponsor. The 2026 season represents the tour's most ambitious year yet, spanning 26 tournaments across 18 countries with the introduction of a groundbreaking new scoring system.

## Tour Structure & Tournament Categories

Premier Padel events are organized into three tiers, each carrying different ranking points, prize money, and draw sizes:

- **Majors**: The most prestigious events on the calendar. These attract the largest fields, highest prize money, and maximum ranking points. Comparable to Grand Slams in tennis.
- **P1 Events**: Premium tour stops that serve as the backbone of the season. They carry significant ranking implications and strong prize purses.
- **P2 Events**: High-level international tournaments that provide competitive opportunities and ranking points for players outside the top tiers.

Both men's and women's draws run simultaneously at most events, though prize money parity remains an ongoing discussion in the sport.

## 2026 Season Calendar

The 2026 Qatar Airways Premier Padel Tour runs from **February 2 to December 13**, featuring:

- **26 tournaments across 18 countries**
- Nearly **75% of events played indoors**
- Events spanning Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and the Americas
- **Three new host cities**: London (United Kingdom), Pretoria (South Africa), and Valencia (Spain)

### Major Tournaments in 2026

- **Paris Major** (September)
- **Premier Padel Finals** in Barcelona (December 7-13), featuring the top 16 men and women from the FIP Race Ranking

## Prize Money Breakdown

Prize money varies significantly across tournament categories. Based on the 2025 allocations (which provide the baseline for 2026):

| P1       | ~€470,000       |

### Per-Player Earnings by Round (Men's)
| Round          | Major    | P1       | P2       |
|----------------|----------|----------|----------|
| Winner         | €47,250  | €25,500  | €15,000  |

Prize money in padel remains considerably lower than in tennis, but purses have grown significantly year-over-year as the sport professionalizes.

## Qualification & Ranking System

### FIP Ranking
Players qualify for events based on their **FIP World Ranking**, which accumulates points from Premier Padel and CUPRA FIP Tour results. The ranking determines:

- Direct entry into Main Draws
- Seedings within draws
- Qualification for the season-ending Premier Padel Finals (top 16 per category)

### The New Star Point Scoring System
Approved unanimously by the FIP General Assembly on November 28, 2025, the **Star Point** is a hybrid scoring system introduced for the 2026 season. It applies across Premier Padel, CUPRA FIP Tour, FIP Promises, and amateur FIP Beyond circuits.

**How it works** (activates at the first deuce in any game):

1. **First advantage**: If the advantaged pair wins the next point, they win the game. If they lose, score returns to deuce (40-40).
2. **Second advantage**: Same as above. If the advantaged pair loses this point, play moves to the Star Point.
3. **Star Point**: A single decisive point determines the game winner, regardless of who served.

This system limits prolonged deuce situations, improving match pacing for broadcast while maintaining competitive integrity. It balances tradition (keeping advantage play) with innovation (capping marathon games).

## Premier Padel Finals

The season-ending **Premier Padel Finals** in Barcelona (December 7-13, 2026) is the tour's marquee event. The top 16 men and women from the FIP Race Ranking compete in a round-robin-to-knockout format, determining the season champions.
