## What Is Padel?

Padel is a racket sport played on an enclosed court with glass walls. It combines elements of tennis and squash, but the smaller court and underhand serve make it easier to pick up than either sport.

Most beginners can rally and play competitive games after just one or two sessions.

## Why Padel Is Perfect for Beginners

- **Smaller court:** Less ground to cover than tennis
- **Underhand serve:** Easier to execute consistently
- **Wall play:** Balls stay in play longer, creating more rallies
- **Social format:** Always played in doubles, so you learn with a partner
- **Low barrier:** You can rent equipment at any Miami club

## Beginner-Friendly Courts in Miami

### [Club Name 2]

### [Club Name 3]
Open play sessions for new players on Sunday afternoons.

## How to Find Your First Game

1. **Book a group lesson:** Most clubs run weekly beginner clinics for $20-40
2. **Bring a friend:** Padel is doubles, so grab a partner and book a court
3. **Join open play:** Many clubs host beginner-only pickup sessions
4. **Use player-matching apps:** Playtomic lets you filter by skill level

## Essential Gear for Beginners

- **Racket:** Rent one at the club for your first sessions ($5-10)
- **Shoes:** Tennis or indoor court shoes with non-marking soles
- **Clothing:** Athletic wear, similar to tennis
- **Balls:** Provided by the club or included with court rental

## Next Steps
