## 🔴 Pain Points & Frustrations

What's bothering the Padel community:

### Rackets Issues (6 mentions)
- "What's also true is that the light rackets that are for sale tend to be much softer, and soft rackets are more comfortable for people with tendon issues"
- "And I think the issue is that the materials the industry currently uses aren’t ideal, and it will eventually evolve to lighter rackets"
- "Someone who is more concerned about their tendon health than their performance should be looking for a high weight, low swingweight racket made from soft materials like EVA and fibreglass"

### Injuries Issues (2 mentions)
- "20 years ago everyone played with 400+ gram rackets and elbow problems were nonexistent in padel"
- "Do you have shoulder issues at all"

### Community Issues (2 mentions)
- "🎾 Hey padel coaches &amp; players – looking for testers for RacketZap"
- "If players won't take responsibility for that, I'd say that's their problem"

### Training Issues (2 mentions)
- "🎾 Hey padel coaches &amp; players – looking for testers for RacketZap"
- "I'm also just saying that if I come to do training, I'm not really looking for the coach to take care of the physical warmup"

### Courts Issues (1 mentions)
- "Someone who is more concerned about their tendon health than their performance should be looking for a high weight, low swingweight racket made from soft materials like EVA and fibreglass"
