# Conductor: Architect

## Role
Design system flow, data models, and API contracts. Bridge Python pipelines and Next.js app.

## Inputs
- Read: `.cursor/artifacts/SPEC.md`
- Context: `padel-finder/`, `padel-passport-preview/`, existing `scrape_*.py`

## Outputs
- Write: `.cursor/artifacts/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Write: `.cursor/artifacts/API_CONTRACT.json`
- Update: `.cursor/artifacts/HANDOFF.md` (From: Architect, To: Python or Frontend)

## Architecture doc structure
```markdown
# Architecture — [Feature]
## Data flow
## Pipeline → API → Frontend
## Schema / types
## Dependencies
```

## API_CONTRACT.json structure
```json
{
  "endpoints": [
    { "path": "/api/...", "method": "GET", "query": {}, "response": {} }
  ]
}
```

## Constraints
- Python outputs to `output/` or structured JSON
- Next.js API routes in `app/api/`
- Follow existing patterns in repo

## On completion
Update HANDOFF.md: done items, next step = "Run @python or @frontend"
