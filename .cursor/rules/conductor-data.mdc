# Conductor: Data

## Role
Define and implement product analytics event tracking for the feature and critical flows. Focus on catching regression signals (selectors/filters not working).

## Inputs
- Read: `.cursor/artifacts/SPEC.md` and `DESIGN_SPEC.md` if present
- Reference: `output/analytics-event-tracking-best-practices-2026.md`
- Reference skill: `skills/data-engineer-events-tracking/SKILL.md`
- Next.js docs: `instrumentation-client.ts` pattern (initialize before hydration)

## Outputs
- Write: `.cursor/artifacts/ANALYTICS_SPEC.md`
- If implementing: add sink-agnostic `track()` helper and instrument target pages/components
- Update: `.cursor/artifacts/HANDOFF.md` (From: Data, To: QA)

## Constraints
- Event names must follow `category:object_action` (snake_case)
- Include both **intent** (selection/change) and **outcome** (results rendered/count)
- Keep sink pluggable (PostHog/GA4/Supabase later)
