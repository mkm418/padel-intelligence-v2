# Frontend Design Skill

This skill guides creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this when building:
- Web components and UI elements
- Landing pages and marketing sites
- Dashboards and data visualization interfaces
- Web applications and SaaS products
- Any frontend interface requiring high design quality

## Design Thinking Framework

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:

### 1. Purpose
- What problem does this interface solve?
- Who uses it? (developers, executives, consumers, etc.)
- What's the primary user journey?

### 2. Tone & Aesthetic Direction
Pick an extreme and commit to it:
- **Brutally minimal**: Stark, high contrast, generous whitespace
- **Maximalist chaos**: Dense, layered, information-rich
- **Retro-futuristic**: Nostalgic tech aesthetics with modern polish
- **Organic/natural**: Soft curves, earth tones, natural textures
- **Luxury/refined**: Elegant typography, subtle animations, premium feel
- **Playful/toy-like**: Bright colors, bouncy animations, friendly
- **Editorial/magazine**: Strong typography hierarchy, grid-based
- **Brutalist/raw**: Exposed structure, monospace fonts, stark
- **Art deco/geometric**: Sharp angles, symmetry, bold patterns
- **Industrial/utilitarian**: Function-first, technical aesthetics

**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work - the key is intentionality, not intensity.

### 3. Constraints
- Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility)
- Browser support needs
- Responsive breakpoints
- Performance budgets

### 4. Differentiation
- What makes this UNFORGETTABLE?
- What's the one thing someone will remember?
- What breaks convention in a meaningful way?

## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines

### Typography
- Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting
- **AVOID**: Arial, Inter, Roboto, system fonts (generic AI defaults)
- **USE**: Distinctive choices that elevate the interface
- Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font
- Consider font weight, letter spacing, line height carefully
- Use typography to establish hierarchy and rhythm

### Color & Theme
- Commit to a cohesive aesthetic
- Use CSS variables for consistency
- Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes
- **AVOID**: Purple gradients on white backgrounds (cliché)
- Consider dark mode, light mode, or high-contrast themes
- Use color to guide attention and establish mood

### Motion & Animation
- Use animations for effects and micro-interactions
- Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML
- Use Motion library for React when available
- Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay) creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions
- Use scroll-triggering and hover states that surprise
- Consider loading states, transitions, and state changes

### Spatial Composition
- Unexpected layouts that break from templates
- Asymmetry with purpose
- Overlap and layering
- Diagonal flow and grid-breaking elements
- Generous negative space OR controlled density (both work with intention)
- Consider the visual rhythm and pacing

### Backgrounds & Visual Details
Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors:
- Gradient meshes and complex gradients
- Noise textures and grain overlays
- Geometric patterns and tessellations
- Layered transparencies
- Dramatic shadows and depth
- Decorative borders and frames
- Custom cursors
- Contextual effects that match the aesthetic

## What to NEVER Do

**NEVER** use generic AI-generated aesthetics:
- ❌ Overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts)
- ❌ Cliched color schemes (purple gradients on white)
- ❌ Predictable layouts and component patterns
- ❌ Cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character
- ❌ Same design choices across different projects

## Implementation Guidelines

### Match Complexity to Vision
- **Maximalist designs** need elaborate code with extensive animations and effects
- **Minimalist designs** need restraint, precision, and careful attention to spacing, typography, and subtle details
- Elegance comes from executing the vision well, not from complexity

### Code Quality
Implement working code that is:
- Production-grade and functional
- Visually striking and memorable
- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view
- Meticulously refined in every detail
- Well-commented and maintainable

### Framework Flexibility
This skill works with:
- Plain HTML/CSS/JS
- React (with or without frameworks like Next.js)
- Vue
- Svelte
- Any modern frontend stack

## Examples of Strong Aesthetic Directions

### Example 1: Data Dashboard (Brutalist)
- Monospace fonts throughout
- High contrast black/white/accent color
- Grid-based layout with exposed structure
- No rounded corners, stark rectangles
- Minimal animations, focus on data clarity

### Example 2: Marketing Landing Page (Luxury)
- Elegant serif display font + refined sans-serif body
- Muted color palette with gold accents
- Generous whitespace and breathing room
- Subtle parallax and fade-in animations
- Premium photography and careful image treatment

### Example 3: Developer Tool (Retro-Futuristic)
- Terminal-inspired aesthetics with modern polish
- Neon accent colors on dark background
- Scanline effects and CRT-inspired textures
- Monospace code fonts with character
- Glitch effects on hover states

## Remember

**Claude is capable of extraordinary creative work.** Don't hold back. Show what can truly be created when thinking outside the box and committing fully to a distinctive vision.

Interpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context. No design should be the same. Vary between light and dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics.
